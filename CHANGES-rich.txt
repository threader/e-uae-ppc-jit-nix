- If options file not found in home directory or current directory, then
  use home directory as default path. This enables the GTK+ UI to save
  a newly generated config file in a sane place.
- In SDL target, changed full-screen mode to always grab mouse input. This
  works around mouse motion problems in full-screen mode in OS X.
- Kludged on a widget for selecting cycle-exact CPU mode in the gtk UI. I
  don't want to add much to the GUI just now because it's in the process of
  being rewritten - but this was cheap to do and it doesn't make sense to
  build in cycle-exact mode if it cannot be easily used.
- Tweaks to allow building without cycle-exact CPU (CPUEMU_6 undefined).
  There's no config file support for this as yet, but if you want to save
  buckets of time when compiling, load up src/Makefile and remove that
  define in CFLAGS and cpuemu_*_6.o/compemu_*_6.o from OBJS.
- Fixed a race condition which caused the name of a newly selected kickstart
  image or key file sometimes not to be displayed.
- Added a scale factor to read_processor_time() on x86 target. People were
  reporting timing problems on fast machines, and I believe the problem is due
  to the number of ticks per second of the processor clock (syncbase) not
  fitting in a signed int (on 2GHz+ machines). By scaling down the clock
  (currently by a factor of 16), hopefully this problem is solved. Also
  modified the RDTSC call to return the processor time as a full 64-bits. This
  is needed so that scaled down clock still rolls over in 32 bits (and indeed
  read_processor_time() still returns time as 32 bits).
- Added a patch from Stephen Anthony to make the floppy file dialog in gtkui
  remember the last path used (saves all that searching through folders to
  find the right ADF file).
- Initial implementation of hardfile support on Unix (no LFS or Gtk GUI
  support yet). RDB hardfiles cause problems with recent versions of HDToolBox
  which needs to be further investigated.
- Some minor tweaks to AmigaOS and BeOS targets (AmigaOS target should now
  build out of the box, but still a lot of work to do on BeOS).
- Lots of tidying doing trivial syncs with WinUAE 0.8.22r9.
- Cleaned up sleep_millis() and sleep_millis_busy(). They're now in sleep.c
  and will call my_usleep() - which will be replaced with an apropriate libc
  or OS call depending on what's available (e.g., nanosleep(), usleep() or
  SDL_Delay()). sleep_millis() will now busy wait if possible when asked to
  sleep for less than 10ms (the granularity of most system sleep routines will
  not allow sleeping for shorter periods - according to the docs).
  sleep_millis_busy() will now only sleep if busy waiting is not required (for
  sub-10ms sleeps).
- Cleaned up MAX_PATH nonsense. Arbitrarily assigned a value of 512 if it's
  not defined. (We could use MAXPATHLEN from POSIX headers, but this value
  is just as arbitrary and rather wasteful. E.g., it's 2048 on Linux. Anybody
  really need paths that long?)
- Commented out unused routines createinputfile(), etc. in zfile.c which were
  there to support external dms tool but are no longer required (and anyway
  don't build on AmigaOS without ixemul due to the lack of the dubious
  tempnam() function).
- Tidied up usage of strcmpi() and stricmp(). Replaced with strcasecmp() and
  added configure support for substituting strcasecmp() for one of these if
  it isn't available. (Shouldn't be necessary. strcasecmp() is a BSD standard,
  but the other two are aren't always available - e.g. Linux doesn't have them.)
- Fixed configure script to build bsdsocket emulation by default only on
  Unix platforms.
- Fixed misreporting of bsdsocket emulation not being built when it has been.

20031202
- Modified gencpu (and build scripts) to generate cpuemu.c in three pieces
  like it does in WinUAE. This should require less memory to build the CPU
  emulation and should thus speed up compilation on GCC3 (it also opens the
  door to compile-time configuration of the CPU emulation).
- Modified configure script to omit X86_ASSEMBLY option when building for
  x86 BeOS (it doesn't work there).
- Modified configure script to allow building with GCC 3 on x86 (this was
  already possible on other archs). The cpuopti step is simply omitted
  (since cpuopti won't currently work with GCC 3 output).
- Updated Amiga target. Closer to building now (with GCC at least). Sound and
  joystick support still to do, and config options probably need tweaking.
- Add updated Solaris sound driver from Elmar Plischke.
- Added patch from Elmar to allow bsdsocket emulation to compile on Solaris.
- Removed GNU varargs macros throughout (this should allow UAE to be compiled
  without GCC once more). Thanks to Elmar for pointing this out.
- Freeing memory in mapped_free() was broken when JIT was compiled in but
  direct memory access disabled. Fixed
- Imported support for using DMS floppy images from WinUAE.
- Support for using zipped or gzipped ADF files was broken. Fixed.
- Accept __POWERPC__ and __ppc__ as a synonyms of __powerpc__ when
  testing for PPC architecture in configure script (GCC on MacOS X uses
  these).
- Cleaned up custom.c and drawing.c in preparation for merge with WinUAE. (This
  breaks P96 in SDL and X11 targets. I've fixed SDL, but X11 fix is still to
  do).
- Added support for switching between windowed/full-screen mode on SDL target,
  even when SDL doesn't support SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen (e.g. MacOS X).
- Added hack to allow the use of F11 as the hot-key modifier in SDL target.
  F12 doesn't work as other keys under MacOS X it seems. Key up/down events
  are generated only when the key is released - so it's no good for a hot-key
  modifier.
- When changing from a P96 screen mode to an Amiga screen mode, a segfault
  could occur. Fixed.
- JIT causes segfault on start-up on 2.6 kernels (and some 2.4 kernels).
  Problem is due to messing about with the processes's LDT (Local Descriptor
  Table) to accelerate access to VM's memory. Disabled this for now until I
  find a solution.
- Partial support for Danish keyboards in SDL target (some keys aren't
  currently supported by SDL keysyms).

20031118
- Added scripts to build debian package
- Added Carl Drougge's bsdsocket.library and source to package (this handles
  the Amiga side of his bsdsocket emulation, which is already included in this
  tree).
- Added this changelog to package
- Updated docs dir from uae-0.8.22 (I still had 0.8.21).
- Added 1280x960 screen mode to SDL and X11 targets - I prefer square pixels!
- Changing Amiga/P96 screen mode in SDL target while mouse was grabbed would
  screw mouse motion because UAE would forget mouse mode. Fixed.
- Changing Amiga/P96 screen mode in SDL target would cause full-screen mode
  to be lost. Fixed.
- Changing P96 screen mode to a larger mode in SDL target caused a crash. Fixed.
- Re-did video mode selection in SDL target. 15-bit modes now work for P96.
- Ensured that files which include the SDL headers do so with the proper
  path (That is, no path. It's provided by sdl-config).
- Lots of clean-ups in preparation for getting stuff merged in the WinUAE tree.
- Removed code for the Windows target from this tree. Eventually I want to
  get it building with MinGW, Cygwin and maybe even OpenWatcom - but we're
  some way from that goal, so for right now we'll just save some bandwidth.
- Removed code for Acorn, pOS, DOS, OS/2 and NeXT targets. I'm sure that these
  don't work now, and I don't have the facilities to test them anyway.
- Recoded source files to ensure the use of Unix-style end-of-line markers.
  GCC on BeOS was barfing on the DOS CR/LF codes that accidentally got imported
  from the WinUAE tree.

20031113
- Added mapping of left and right "super" keys (Windows keys on a Windows
  keyboard) to left and right Amiga keys in SDL and X targets.
- Swapped mapping of apostrophe and back quote keys in SDL target

20031106
- Silly me. Timehack was demanding clocks to be exactly in sync with 1us
  accuracy.  Made it less strict and only update amiga time if it is out by
  more  than 1ms.
- Added dummy set_thread_priority() function in sdl and posix thread
  wrappers (require if using filesystem threads).
- Tweaks for configure script:
  * Better detection of when thread support is required (currently
    filesystem code requires threads - even when not building with
    UAE_FILESYS_THREADS option - due to dependency on hardfile code).
  * Filesystem threads will now be compiled in by default
  * Configure now works again on BeOS (whether it will build is another
    story.)
- Fixes to re-enable building without a GUI.
- Made bsdsocket emulation a compile-time option.
- Really fix dummy joystick driver in od-generic.
- Fixed joystick counting in Linux joystick driver.
- Fixed mouse button mapping in X target.
- Fixed moused movement in DGA mode and when grabbed in X target
- Fixed X pointer being displayed in UAE window after grabbing and
  ungrabbing mouse with X target.
- Fixed various functions which should have been exported from
  gfxutil.c but were declared static.

20031011
- Fixed UAE side of timehack which was translating Unix Epoch UTC
  time to Amiga Epoch UTC+2.
- Added support in Amiga side of timehack for setting clock to local time
  using offset from UTC read from environment variable TZ. Added 
  break handling, so you can now kill the damn thing.
- Ported dummy sound driver in generic target to new sound API. 
- Put back big-endian fixes for OSS sound target (which for some reason 
  never made it into this tree).
- Got X11 target compiling again. Still needs work on mouse handling.
- Linux joystick driver now works. (Did it ever work before?) Not tested
  on BSD, though. This uses the old and crap v0.x Linux joystick API.
  Need to add a driver for the new API.
- Lots of of clean-up in input layer. Ported all the joystick drivers
  to the new inputdevice API and thus got rid of some of my hacks
  in input-dummy.c (this will eventually go away all together).
- GTK+ GUI now works on Darwin/MacOS X with SDL threads. POSIX semaphores
  appear to be broken there, however.
- Cleaned up threads targets. Implemented the sleep_millis() function
  in each of the thread.h targets (previously, SDL implementation was
  in sdlgfx.c). Now you can build with SDL threads without SDL gfx.
- Added debug logging to GTK+ GUI.
- Lots of clean-up in GTK+ GUI. Reworked pausing and quitting code.
  Verified that no GTK+ widgets are directly accessed from main UAE
  thread - hopefully clearing up GUI lock-up problems that have been
  reported. Moved more code into gtk_gui_thread() and added a semaphore
  to sync with UAE thread on GUI start-up.
- Started documenting GTK+ code.
- Fixed font problem in About page of GTK+ GUI. The code was changing
  the default font style, not just applying style to widget (although
  this bug didn't seem to effect any of my Linux boxes, it did show up on
  Darwin).
- Fixed sizing policy of GTK+ main window. When the window's vertical
  size was increased, the Snaphots gadgets would expand - which looked
  very ugly. Now they don't.

20031005
- First stab at a GTK message box implementation that is used to report
  certain warnings to the user via a GUI dialog rather than just dumping a
  message on the console. (It's not used much, yet, but is used to report
  problems in loading a Kickstart image, etc.)
- More mucking about with memory.c. Verified that differences with WinUAE
  are either bugs in WinUAE or differences in the way Windows does things.
  Did some more tidying up and started doing some documentation.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a segfault if the ROM keyfile (for encoded
  Cloanto ROMs) was unable to be read.
- Hacked a solution to the problem that most config changes effected in the
  GTK GUI wouldn't be saved out to a config file unless the VM was running
  (to accept the changes).
- Fixed a bug with the new input subsystem and the GTK UI that that meant
  changes in joystick port preferences didn't take effect and couldn't be
  saved out in the config file.
- Added config file support for 8-bit sound back in. 
- Started bringing back some of the snaphost code (still not ready to go yet,
  though).

20031003
- Fixed problem with SDL not cleaning up if UAE dies horribly or is killed.
  Now, when running full-screen and UAE dies, you should get your X display
  back.
- Finished merging the new config-file code from WinUAE (many of the new
  config options aren't actually used yet, though). New filesys config code
  may cause problems with config files from my earlier versions and cause
  duplicate disks to be mounted. Just go into the hard drive section of the
  config and remove any duplicates. (In hindsight, I should have merged all
  the new config code in one go.)
- Disabled the load and save snapshot buttons in the GTK+ UI. The snapshot
  function isn't actually useable yet. I'll re-enable them when it is.
- Merged latest ShapeShifter hack from WinUAE and did some tidying up
  of memory.c.
- Switched a lot of the debugging output in bsdsocket.c to be generated only
  with a compile-time option (cut down the rubbish dumped to the console).

20031001
- Fixed endian problem with P96 screens on SDL on big-endian hardware such as
  the PPC. This is a quick fix and just chooses the right byte-order for pixel
  encoding depending on the host machine's byte-order. A better fix would take
  account of the display's byte-order rather than the host's (similar applies to
  the previous AGA fix). This and a fix for plain X11 target to do. There
  appears to still be an occasional problem with P96 on 32-bit screens where red
  and blue guns are swapped. Possibly a bug somewhere in the blitting code
  in the P96 emulation. Need more time to investigate.
  
20030930 (mistakenly tagged the release as 20030330)
- Fixed endian problem with AGA screens on big-endian hardware such as the
  PPC.
- Fixed bug in the GTK+ UI which stopped the AGA option in the chipset page
  being selected even when it was selected in your config.

20030928-3
- Fixed problem with processor time calculations on the ppc-gcc target. This
  fix will have wide-ranging effects on UAE's performance on the PPC, since
  the processor timer (the PPC's timebase counter) is used to
  synchronize m68k emulation with custom chip emulation. 'Adjustable' cpu mode
  now works.

20030928-2
- Binary only release due to hosed PPC binary. Ooops.

20030928
- First release to the A1g3dev mailing list.
- Loads and loads of changes and fixes to plain old UAE-0.8.22 including:
  * Latest CPU, x86 JIT and custom-chip emulations from WinUAE 0.8.22r9
  * Latest filesystem code from WinUAE 0.8.22r9 (notification on a virtual
    filesystem should now work).
  * New input device code merged from WinUAE. Needs testing and attention.
  * Several SDL fixes, particularly with clean-up and exiting.
  * Fixed 16-bit SDL and OSS sound for big-endian machines
  * Loads of GTK+ UI fixes, particularly with threading and exiting.
  * Fixed bugs in floppy section of GTK+ UI (as a plus the LEDs now work).
  * Replaced hard drive section of the GTK+ UI. A lot more useable.
  * Assorted config and make script tweaks
  * Assorted fixes to clean up code and cut down on compiler warnings.
  * Possibly more that have I forgotten about . . .
