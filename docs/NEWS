Note! This file only contains user-visible changes. There may be others. For a
more detailed description of changes between releases, read src/ChangeLog, and
for the full picture, make a diff between releases.

User-visible changes in 0.8.22:
  - Mostly bug fixes
  - Extensive updates for the sprite emulation and blitter timing code.
    Hopefully more accurate than before.

User-visible changes in 0.8.21:
  - Several bug fixes, including some serious filesystem emulation bugs.
  - Support for A1000 boot ROMs.

User-visible changes in 0.8.20:
  - Bug fixes only

User-visible changes in 0.8.19:
  - A few bug fixes, especially in state-saving.
  - Picasso screens now support panning.

User-visible changes in 0.8.18:
  - Numerous bug fixes.
  - The gtk UI has more options; it also now behaves similar to the GUI found
    in the Windows version in that it waits for the user to explicitly start
    the emulation, thus allowing to select the desired options first.
  - There's a track and LED display added to the bottom of the screen.

User-visible changes in 0.8.17:
  - AGA should be a bit faster.
  - AGA sprites emulation added by Toni Wilen.
  - Numerous bug fixes.
  - In the Unix version, the gtk UI has a lot more options available.
    There's a new option "Enable copper speedup code"; I'd be interested in
    hearing whether there's any software out there that does not work (or
    runs slower) if this option is enabled.
  - Now supports image files of high density floppies (Dr. Adil Temel).
  - Support for A1000 Kickstart disks (Gerald Schnabel).
  - The option to disable autoconfig devices no longer exists; the emulator
    automatically recognizes if the Kickstart version is too old.
  - Numerous improvements for the integrated debugger.
  - State save/restore implemented by Toni Wilen.  At the moment, this is
    experimental, "use at your own risk" code.  It is not guaranteed that
    future versions of the emulator will be able to read snapshots saved by
    this version.  Test it and report bugs.

User-visible changes in 0.8.16:
  - AGA playfield support (again) (Toni Wilen)
  - In addition to plain mono and stereo, there's a new sound setting "mixed".
  - There's a new option to set CPU speeds more accurately, it's called
    "finegrain_cpu_speed".
  - Numerous bug fixes
  - Graphics should be faster; optimized code was accidentally commented out
    in the previous release.
  
User-visible changes in 0.8.15:
  - A few changes in the core of the custom chip emulation; this should mean
    more accuracy in general, but likely also a few new bugs in this version.
    It may be a little slower as well.
  - "68040" emulation.  Dedicated to all the clueless folks out there.
    (with thanks to Christian Bauer)

User-visible changes in 0.8.14:
  - More bug fixes:
    * CPU emulation problem that could have caused copy protection schemes to
      malfunction has been fixed.
    * Some AGA problems fixed (one of them visible in ECS modes).
    * UAE should work again on non-x86 systems.
  - By default the emulator will try to approximate an A500 in CPU speed.
    This setting existed before, but it's a bit more accurate now and on by
    default.
  - There is a new option to control the number of emulated disk drives.
  - Software autofire for the keyboard joystick replacements

User-visible changes in 0.8.13:
  - Bye bye GGI port
  - Several bugs fixed, mostly in the filesystem code
  - AGA updates

User-visible changes in 0.8.12:
  - Several bugfixes

User-visible changes in 0.8.11:
  - Finally, an accurate copper emulation, thanks to Sam Jordan.
  - Sprite emulation fixes, also due to Sam Jordan.
  - Some CPU emulation fixes (Keith Rollin, Toni Wilen, Lauri Pesonen)
  - Old command line options actually work now.
  - Some floppy related lockups removed.

User-visible changes in 0.8.10:
  - Audio interpolation
  - Bugfixes for
    * disk emulation
    * FPU emulation
    * CPU prefetch emulation (the "compatible" setting).
    * some 2.0+ filesystem packets
    * text-based UI (should compile again)
    * some other parts
  - People like me who liked the old command line options better can now use
    (most of) them again.

User-visible changes in 0.8.9:
  - The filesystem emulation should be able to emulate an Amiga FS more
    accurately.  Script/Pure bits and filenotes are kept.
  - Patrick Ohly contributed SCSI support (currently Linux only) that allows
    you to (e.g.) use CD writers with the emulator.

User-visible changes in 0.8.8:
  - I'm sure there were some.

User-visible changes in 0.8.7:
  - Commandline and configuration file handling has been redone. The old
    options are now longer supported
  - Hardfiles and filesystems are called DHx: instead of UAEx:
  - Filesystem emulation supports more 2.0+ packets
  - FPU works again

User-visible changes in 0.8.6:
  - Black scanlines implemented ('D' modifier for "-O" option)
  - Should no longer crash when resetting the emulation
  - DOS port update
  - Improvements in X11 and ncurses user interfaces.
  - Sound can be re-configured at run-time in the UI.

User-visible changes in 0.8.5:
  - Prettier gtk user interface
  - Swedish documentation by Jonas Holm Pileborg
  - Might compile with BSD make
  - The 68000 MOVEP instruction works properly
  - Many Win32 code updates - it _might_ compile out of the box for you if
    your compiler setup is identical to mine

User-visible changes in 0.8.4:
  - The option "-O" has two new modifiers, 'a' and 'p'.

User-visible changes in 0.8.3:
  - Amiga and GGI ports updated
  - X11 version supports DGA and windowed mode in one binary, hotkeys, and a
    mouse grabbing mode

User-visible changes in 0.8.2:
  - Should compile on *BSD and on non-x86 systems again.
  - Better gtk detection (hopefully)
  - Fixed bugs that made the low bandwidth feature and dithered color output
    unusable in the X11 version.
  - The X11 driver can now display 8 bit Picasso screens even on truecolor X
    displays.

User-visible changes in 0.8.1:
  - BeOS update (Christian Bauer)
  - New copper code that should be more exact and maybe a little bit faster.
  - Picasso bug fixed that caused corruption of window scrollbars.
  - Fix for problems in interlace modes on line doubled displays.
  - The CPU emulation can try to approximate the speed of a 7MHz A500.

User-visible changes in 0.8.0:
  - Better support for some BSD variants.
  - Fixed a display bug that caused dual playfield displays in high resolution
    to look wrong.
  - The gtk UI no longer crashes when the "-G" option is used.

User-visible changes in 0.7.0:
  - Picasso96 graphics card emulation by Brian King.
  - All CPU emulations (68000, 68010, 68020, 68020 + FPU, 68000 compatible)
    are now compiled into one binary and selectable at run-time.
  - Many changes in hardfile support. Now you can mount several hardfiles in
    arbitrary order. You can specify the geometry for every hardfile.
    The hardfile device has been renamed to "uaehf.device". Please adjust your
    MountList entry.
  - Stereo sound support
  - UAE has been ported to pOS by Samuel Devulder
  - New sound back-end that just writes sound to a file.
  - Improved serial support
  - The XFree86 VidMode extension is supported; if you use it, the X11 version
    will switch to the video mode that is "closest" to what you specified on
    the commandline.
  - Many minor and major bugfixes

User-visible changes in 0.6.9:
  - The sprite code finally seems to work now (well, mostly :( )
  - Sprite-to-sprite collisions implemented
  - EHB and dual playfield modes are faster on x86 systems.
  - Disk changes should be detected again.
  - Believe it or not, I think the reset and quit buttons in the UI actually
    work this time.
  - POSIX_PENGUINS for Linux systems with glibc-2.0. There's now real hope
    that it speeds things up on SMP machines (it still slows down single
    processor machines if it's enabled, though).
  - The filesystem code should be somewhat more robust. It can also be set up
    to run multi-threaded. That makes sense even on single processor machines.
  - The old follow-mouse hack for the X version is disabled. There is now a
    new Amiga program named "mousehack". Please put it in the directory you
    use for harddisk emulation and put the command "run >NIL: mousehack" in 
    your startup-sequence.
  - 4 or 8 MB chip memory are supported.
  - Two joysticks are supported on Linux systems, as well as several
    alternative keyboard "fake" joysticks (using two simultaneously is
    possible). Also, two joystick buttons are now supported.
  - The SVGAlib/DOS version user interface is a bit improved. It can now be
    used during the emulation by pressing F11, e.g. for changing disks.
  - For the non-DGA X11 version, the LOW_BANDWITH and DONT_WANT_SHM compile
    options have been turned into the -L and -T run-time options.
  - Linux/GGI port by Christian Schmitt/Stefan Reinauer (untested)

User-visible changes in 0.6.8:
  - This should contain all the necessary files...
  - Bugfixes

User-visible changes in 0.6.7:
  - Some bugs in the new playfield code removed; some speed improvements
  - New alternate user-interface for X (note the debugger doesn't completely
    work yet). The Tk GUI is also improved. Note that I don't use either, so
    there are no stability guarantees.
  - The options "-d" and "-C" are replaced with "-O", which allows much better
    control over the graphics display. The old options will continue to work
    for a few more releases and will be removed after that.
  - Yet Another Blitter Bug fixed (Sanity Arte demo)
  - Blitter control by copper now works (would have worked before if I hadn't
    forgotten the COPCON register)
  - On Linux systems (running at least kernel version 1.3.something) UAE can
    now be set up to run in two threads. That's only potentially useful on SMP
    machines, it's a performance loss on other machines. It currently is most
    probably a big performance loss even on SMP machines: The implementation
    is very primitive. This is just to get started.

User-visible changes in 0.6.6:
  - Playfield hardware emulation almost completely rewritten. It _should_ be
    somewhat more stable and bugfree, but there's no doubt that there are some
    new fun and exciting bugs in this version.
    Features: Interlace drawing merges two frames and should look better, plus
      it now works with even frame skip values.
      The copper is more accurate.
      Sprite DMA works better (see Interference by Sanity)
      Some other bugs removed.
  - The spanish keyboard now has a "W".
  - Nice pictures in the Tk GUI.
  - The USER_PROGRAMS_BEHAVE compile-time option now "works" even if you don't
    use the compiler.

User-visible changes in 0.6.5:
  - Bugfixes in the filesystem code and in the compiler
  - There was some speed loss in 0.6.4, which should be fixed for the i386
    versions. Actually, UAE won't run on a 386 anymore (uses the bswapl
    instruction). It would be pointless anyway...
  - The text user interface in the SVGAlib and DOS versions supports harddisks
    better
  - The XFree86 DGA extension is supported.
  - Italian documentation by Paolo Besser.
  - Spanish keyboard support for X; French keyboard updated
  - I _hope_ that the X version UAE now always resets keyboard autorepeat.
  - Option "-A" to control the accuracy of the emulation. Use "-A 0" to
    restore the old behaviour, which is likely to be somewhat faster.
  - Solaris sound should actually compile this time.
  - The built-in debugger has a "M" command to search for sound modules.

For versions earlier than 0.6.5, you'll have to read the ChangeLog to find out
what's new.
