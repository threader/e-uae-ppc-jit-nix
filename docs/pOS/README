INTRODUCTION
============

This the Amiga port of UAE v0.6.9. UAE is the Un*x Amiga Emulator
written by Bernd Schmidt. 

You should read the README file before this one to know more about uae.
(how to use it, command-line options, what is emulated, and so on...).

This port features many things. It is build with the help of Geekgadget:
GCC, ixemul, ... Thus allowing an easy port of the original unix version
to pOS without a lot of modification. It is also based in part on
examples of the pOS developer package. I am very gratefull to proDAD for
providing me (and other developers) that package.


REQUIREMENTS
============

This version will work on any machine running at least pOS r26. That
version needs ixemul v47.1. UAE needs roughly 6-8Mb of free ram and a
fast processor. It has been tested successfully on a A500 OCS with 
8Mb of fast ram with a 68030 processor (gvp A530 board) running pOS r27.


QUICKSTART
==========

To try quickly UAE, insert a bootable disk in df0 that runs on a standard
A500 (a demo for example), and type in a pOS shell:

    > Stack 32000
    > UAE -L -H2 -S2 -c2 -s2 -f2 -O320:256:XYl -0/dev/df0

Then you should see a window open on you pOS workbench with the demo
running inside.

The emulated amiga with that setup is a standard A500: 512kb chip,
512kb slow fast, sound and full color display.


FEATURES
========

UAE can display in 8 bits or in truecolor (24 bits). In 8bits, UAE
can use a grayscale palette (-H0) or a color palette (-H1). Thoses
two modes does not use the dither and thus gives the maximum rendering
speed but you loose some colors. You can also activate the truecolor
mode (-H2) that will make UAE use all of the 4096 colors ECS can give.
In that case, UAE will automatically dither the output if necessary
thanks to pOS RTG drivers.

If you use the -L option, UAE will try to only update the needed part
of the window. That will propably speed up things a little bit
especially in truecolor mode.

The sound can be emulated in this version. But Amigas Hardware is too
slow for it to be really usefull. On my amiga, UAE produces one second
of sound every twenty seconds in Sanity's Interference demo. Thus, An
amiga which is around 20 times faster as an A4000 would be nice. I
wonder what will this version of UAE give when recompiled for a PPC
running pOS (please tell me if you succed to produce such an executable).

The CPU emulation is speed up by using ASM code to compute flags
directly from the native CPU on m68K and x86 targets. For risc machines
as the PPC, it seems that asm hacks are not usefull, so the generic
C code is used.

You can insert disks by pressing CTRL-LALT-F1, CTRL-LALT-F2,
CTRL-LALT-F3, or CTRL-LALT-F4. F1 corresponds to drive DF0, F2 to DF1,
and so on. Alternatively you can simply eject a disk by pressing
LSHIFT in addition of the above keys.

You can mount native partitions using the -m option. Be sure to use unix
convention when giving a path to UAE. For exemple do not do 

        CLI> uae -m boot:dh0:path -0 /disks/df0.adf 

but rather

        CLI> uae -m boot:/dh0/path -0 ../disks/df0.adf

This is not a bug, but an ixemul.library feature. You can access native
disks by specifying /dev/<device-name>[.device]/unit or /dev/df<num>
after -0. For example you can do "uae -0 /dev/df0" or "uae -0 
/dev/pTrackdisk.device/0" to use the internal floppy drive as drive 0
under UAE. Under the file requester, select the DEV: assign to access
disk-devices.

You can reset the emulator by pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL in UAE's window. I
guess it reminds you about something :^) You can enter debug mode by
pressing ^C or ^D in the cli/shell window or by pressing the close-gadget
of UAE's window.

The F12 key of the X11 version of uae is simulated by pressing
CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-F10 simultanemously. This toggles the mouse emulation
mode and is needed for some games or demos when you find that the
mouse emulation does not work well.

You can toggle on/off the screen rendering to speed up the sound
processing by pressing CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-F9. You can also "iconify" UAE
by pressing on the gagdet next to the depth-gadget. When uae is
iconified, the display is automatically switch off, speeding the
emulation a little bit (be you won't be able to see it as the window
is shrinked :-)

If UAE does not find a rom-file, it'll use the ROM located at address
$F80000 - $FFFFFF. Thus, you need not grab it and that will spare you
some disk space. You can disable this feature by creating the
environment variable "USE_UAE_ERSATZ", in which case UAE will try to
emulate rom calls using a built'in pseudo kickstart. That feature will
probably disappear when pOS will be able to run on other hardwares than
amiga machines.

If you setenv AUDIONAME <filename>, then uae will put the sound-samples
into <filename>. Using that you can grab soundtracks very easily :-).
Notice that <filename> can have two "%d". The first one will be replaced
by the frequency (see the -R flag for UAE) and the second one will be
replaced by the buffer size (-B option).

*NEW*: If under uae you run "amiga/uae_rcli", then you'll be able to 
run AmigaOS commands in UAE just by dropping the icon of the executable 
on UAE's window. 


MISSING FEATURES
================

The joystick can't be used: use the -J flag instead.

No AREXX port available to use an external GUI: use the built-in
pseudo GUI (did you see the leds in the dragbar ? :-)

No mouse-pointer masking.


HOW TO (RE-)BUILD UAE
=====================

You should be familiar with unix programming to build UAE. For the
moment it can only be cross-compiled under AmigaOS as apparently
there is no "ln -s" or "Makelink" support in pOS r27 (That will
probably change in future releases).

If you wish to (re-)build uae, you need to have GeekGadget correctly
installed (see ftp://ftp.ninemoons.com/pub/gg/). Not all part of
Geek Gadget are needed, but be sure to have gcc2.7.2.1, binutils,
autoconf, awk, ...

To compile for pOS you should setenv CFLAGS "-D__POS__" as it is
that define that is used to find the target system. Alternatively, 
you can simply add "--target=p.os" when launching ./configure.

The default Makefile provided is for a MC68030 microprocessor. If you
wish to have a Makefile tuned for your CPU (and fpu), just type "sh -c
configure". If the configure script is correcly written (or with some
extra tuning in Makefiles), UAE should also compile for a x86 or PPC
architecture if you are using a special version of GCC tuned to
cross-compilation (the cpu specific parts of uae are dissociated from
OS specific things). I can't wait trying UAE for pOS on x86 or PPC
plateforms :-)

Once your Makefile is generated (if needed), you can modify the file
"config.h" to suit your needs. I suggest you to define DONT_WANT_SOUND
in "config.h". That will speed up the emulation (sound emulation slows
down the speed by roughly 10%).

When you'll have configured uae correctly, type "make" in a shell. Then
one hour and a half later you'll get the uae executable (it might be less
if you have a *real fast* m68k machine, but don't expect less that 15
minutes). I know it's slow, but Amigas are slow (even those with 68060
are not that fast, by today's standards ;-).

NOTE: I had reports that gcc complains and fail to compile cpu_f?.s.
This is caused by a problem with perl5 and src/md-amiga/cpuopti.
To avoid this you can try to use perl4 instead of perl5, or uncomment
the lines in the beginning of src/md-68k/cpuopti. Unfortunately, UAE
will run slower as the asm files won't have an extra optimization pass.

NOTE 2: With some fiddling, you can succeed in compiling UAE with the
nixpos link-library. That library will give you an executable that can
run without ixemul. But then you'll loose the ability of uae to produce
statistics when you enter 'c' in its debugger. You'll also have to enter
a mandatory space between flags and arguments in the makefile.
