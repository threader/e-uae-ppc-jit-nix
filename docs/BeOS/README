This file documents the details relevant to the BeOS versions of UAE. General
information can be found in the file "README"

System requirements
===================

UAE will run on any System with BeOS PR2/R3.


Compilation
===========

If you want to rebuild UAE, unpack the source archive to an appropriate
directory (e.g. /boot/home). The simple way to proceed is to type "configure;
make". After that has completed you should have a working BeOS version
of UAE. Ignore warnings if you get them.

However, you should probably have a look at some of the compile-time options
found in "config.h" before you do this. There are some things you can change
there so that the resulting executable will perform better on your machine.
Each of the options in that file has a description. You can edit config.h to
suit your needs; and then do "configure; make" afterwards.


Graphics
========

The BeOS version of UAE currently only supports a color depth of 8 bits.
You should set the color depth of the workspace you're running UAE in to
8 bits/pixel for maximum speed.


Sound
=====

The sound currently doesn't work very well. You must start UAE with "-S 2"
or "-S 3" to get sound.


Keyboard
========

Some special keys of the Amiga keyboard are mapped as follows:

  (Amiga)   -> (Be)
  Help      -> Insert
  Amiga     -> Alt
  Alt       -> Wind*ws keys
  Left Alt  -> End
  Right Alt -> Right Control, Page Down
  '(' (NP)  -> Home
  ')' (NP)  -> Page Up


Mouse and joystick emulation
============================

The BeOS version has one problem: There are two mouse pointers, the
X mouse pointer and the Y mouse pointer. You can work that way, but you get
confused quickly.

The solution in previous (0.6.8 and before) versions of UAE was a small piece
of code that looked at the position of sprite 0 on the screen and tried to
generate mouse movements in an emulated hardware port. That worked reasonably
well, but had several problems.

The new solution is to use a small Amiga program which is called "mousehack".
You will find this in the "amiga" subdirectory. Put it into the directory that
you use for harddisk emulation so that you can run it from the emulator. Then
put the command "run >NIL: mousehack" at the top of your startup-sequence. UAE
will detect when this program is running and use the improved mouse pointer
positioning method (don't run this program on old versions of UAE).

If the program is not running, you get the old behaviour - almost. By default,
the emulator will no longer try to keep Amiga and BeOS mouse pointers at the same
position, because that led to problems in the past. You can toggle this
behaviour with F12.

(If you just added "run mousehack" to your startup-sequence, that would have
the effect that the initial CLI window would be impossible to close.
Unfortunately, redirecting output to >NIL: disables all error messages that
mousehack can give you - so if it does not work, try running it by hand
without the >NIL: redirection.)

If you find a program in which the mouse pointer does not move at all if you
use the BeOS version, start that program with mousehack _not_ running
(Magnetic Scrolls adventures are known to need this, for example).

A joystick in port 1 (the lower port) is supported. UAE calibrates the
joystick automatically. Turn it a few times on startup to get the calibration
done. 


Harddisk emulation
==================

Please read the appropriate sections in the file "README" on how to use the
filesystem emulation. There are a few BeOS-specific things about it, though.

If you want to execute files located on a native filesystem, they need to have
the x permission bit set. That can be done in the Bash by "chmod +x file" or
in AmigaDOS with "protect file rwed".

You should set aside a whole directory tree for AmigaOS files, and not use it
from BeOS in any way if you can avoid it. Changing permissions/owners,
creating symbolic links and doing other stuff that AmigaOS does not know about
is a good way to confuse the emulator and the emulated software. E.g. it's
possible to have a symlink pointing at a mounted CD-ROM. The emulator would
see that as a directory inside which it gets "read only filesystem" errors,
and wouldn't know what to do about it. Avoid this sort of thing. It's best to
start with an empty harddisk emulation directory and install software there
only from within the emulation.

The following setup can also lead to problems:

  -m dh0:/foo -m dh1:/foo/bar

Please take care that the filesystems you mount don't overlap each other
(another great reason not to use symbolic links within them).
