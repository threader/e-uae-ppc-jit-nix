Incomplete list of programs that work with UAE. If you have something to add,
mail me.
Most Kickstart versions work. I think I've also had success reports about
68020 Kickstarts. Some special A600 ones which apparently rely on an IDE
interface or the PCMCIA port being present don't work properly.

The following programs were tested by me:
 - Powerpacker 2.3b
 - DME, DICE (compiles at least transdisk and transrom)
 - Turrican I: Works 100% now, unlike in previous versions.
   In world 3 (the vertically scrolling levels) they achieve multi-level
   scrolling by means of _awful_ copper and sprite tricks. It works, but these
   levels are tremendously slow.
 - Katakis (also known as Denaris)
 - Zork Zero
 - Corruption, Fish
 - Holiday Lemmings 1994 (always nice to watch them blow up)
 - Champions of Krynn (including harddisk installation on the unixfs.device)
 - Cybernoid II works, sort of. It occasionally crashes.
 - AmigaCPE (my CPC emulator :-)
 - SimCPM (CP/M emulator, ran some Infocom adventures with it)
 - DMS 1.11
 - Lots of demos
 - TheA64Package
 - AIBB 5.5 and AIBB 6.5. These work, but you need the "-S 3" option for
   maximum sound hardware compatibility (or start AIBB with the "-b" switch).
   Otherwise, the stupid beep when pressing gadgets doesn't work and the
   program gets into an endless loop.
   Oh yes, and the CPU is detected as running at InfMHz :)
 - AmigaBasic

The following programs (among others) were tested by other people:
 - Games: Silkworm I, BattleChess 2, Monkey Island, IK+, Giana Sisters,
   Arkanoid, Team, Vertical Mayhem, The Faery Tale Adventure, various 
   incarnations of The Bard's Tale, The Empire Strikes Back, Worms/OCS,
   Shanghai, R-Type 1 & 2, Battle Squadron, The Sentinel, Elite II (Frontier)
 - Directory Opus
 - Deluxe Paint IV
 - Devpac 3.04
 - Maxon Assembler 1.1
 - KinkWords
 - FileMaster 2.2
 - ImageFX 2.0
 - Aegis Images
 - Atari Lynx development tools
 - CygnusED Prof.
 - DiskMaster 1.4
 - Several packers (PP 4.0, LHA, PKAZIP). Some of these don't like the unixfs.
 - MUI
 - Brilliance
 - Several Cloanto programs have been by Michael C. Battilana from Cloanto
   Software: Personal Paint, ColorType, Personal Fonts Maker and Personal Write
   (all versions)
 - Shapeshifter. This requires 68020 emulation, and apparently you need to use
   "Prepareemul A1200". You may run into problems with the filesystem code, in
   that case use the hardfile.
 - others

I've removed the incompatibility list, since these things vary a lot. There
are still some programs that don't run.

"Brokenness" notes
==================
Some programs only work on some Amigas, or with some configurations of UAE.
If you have information about more programs, please tell me about it, because
this could be very helpful for other users, too.
Generally, everything that relies on exact timing won't be compatible with
68020 and higher Amigas either.

Incompatible with more than 512K chipram:
 - Silents "ICE" demo (characters missing in sinusscroll part with more chip)
 
Requires exception 3 and is therefore incompatible with 68020+ CPUs:
 - Katakis (Denaris)
 - Cybernoid II (this one relies rather heavily on all sorts of exception
   related behaviour of the CPU).

Requires slow memory (-s option), even if there's plenty other memory:
 - Silents "Global Trash" demo
 - Anarchy "Seeing is Believing" demo
 - Andromeda "Decaying Paradise" demo
 - Spaceballs "State of the Art" demo

Requires exact timing of system componets (exact CPU or blitter timing, etc)
 - Silents "Hardwired" demo (times multiplication instructions and refuses to
   work if they are too fast)
 - Andromeda "Multica" demo (directly processes blitter output without
   waiting for the blitter)
 - Phenomena "Enigma" demo: modifies data while blitter is working on it.
 - Turrican I: Only the "Rainbow Arts" intro, it will abort too early and
   continue loading if the CPU is faster than a 68000. Otherwise fine.

Programs that set reserved bits in custom chip registers:
 - Andromeda "Seven Seas" demo uses EHB and sets the AGA "KILLEHB" bit at the
   same time... It almost seems as if it _wants_ to use EHB on OCS machines
   and a regular 6 plane display on AGA machines.
