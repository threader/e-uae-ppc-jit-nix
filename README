uae-0.8.23-20040125
===================

This is an experimental and unofficial version of UAE, the Unix Amiga
Emulator, based on WinUAE 0.8.23. It attempts to bring many of the great
features of WinUAE to non-Windows platforms.

Currently it will build and run (with a varying degree of supported features)
on Linux and other Unices, Mac OS X, BeOS and AmigaOS. (OS X and BeOS both
require either LibSDL or an X server for graphics output. Neither platform
is supported with a purely native graphics driver - yet.)


What's New
==========

Summary:
* Core emulation update from WinUAE 0.8.23 (this includes new features such
  as the new clock synchronization function and map ROM support).
* Improved Picasso96 emulation.
* Improved SDL graphics driver with experimental support for doing raw
  keyboard mapping (see below for more details).
* Mousewheel support in SDL and X11 targets.
* Unified hotkey handling on the supported targets (see below).
* The Gtk+ GUI will now build with GTK+ 2.x.
* New CPU configuration page in the Gtk+ GUI.
* Better screenmode configuration in AmigaOS version.
* Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes.

See the CHANGES file for the full gory details.


Hot keys
========

Hotkey mapping and handling is unified on all the supported platforms. This
may have required some changes from what you have previously been used to.
The keys are now:

F12 + Q                 Quit UAE
F12 + S	                Toggle between windowed display and full-screen mode
      			(if suppported by the graphics driver).
F12 + G	                Toggle mouse-grab mode (in windowed mode)
F12 + M	                Toggle mousehack mode (if mousehack is running)
F12 + I (or
Scroll Lock)            Toggle display inhibit (Amiga screenmodes, not P96)
F12 + P (or
Print Screen)           Save screenshot (if supported)
F12 + A	  	        Cycle through audio interpolation modes
                        (interpolation works with 16-bit audio only)

F12 + Numpad Plus       Increase frame skip rate
F12 + Numpad Minus      Decrease frame skip rate

F12 + F1     	        Insert floppy image in drive 0 (if supported).
F12 + F2	        Insert floppy image in drive 1 (if supported)
F12 + F3	        Insert floppy image in drive 2 (if supported)
F12 + F4	        Insert floppy image in drive 3 (if supported)
F12 + Left Shift + F1	Eject floppy image in drive 0
F12 + Left Shift + F2	Eject floppy image in drive 1
F12 + Left Shift + F3	Eject floppy image in drive 2
F12 + Left Shift + F4	Eject floppy image in drive 3


Notes
-----

1) On Mac OS X, use F11 instead of F12 as hotkey sequence initiator (for
   example press F11+Q to quit UAE).
2) On AmigaOS, use CTRL+Left Alt instead of F11 as hotkey sequence initiator
   (for example, press CTRL+Left Alt+Q to quite UAE).
3) Hotkeys must be pressed and held in the order shown.



Raw keyboard mapping
====================

Support for international keyboards has been rather poor to date in UAE on
Unix. A partial solution to this problem is to map the raw keycode to an Amiga
keycode in response to a keypress (rather than let X map the raw keycode to
a keysm then map that keysym to an Amiga keycode). With raw key-mapping, UAE
no longer has to know about the differences between all the various international
keyboards. The problem now is for UAE to know the type of keycodes it will be
supplied. Different host platforms and different keyboards may generate
different raw keycodes for what is ostensibly the same key. 

This version of UAE currently supports raw key-mapping when built against SDL
and when run on the x11 or dga SDL video drivers with x86 or PowerPC Linux or
when run on the BeOS SDL video driver (support for the OS X Quartz driver will
be available soon).

You may enable it with the config option (it defaults to false)

sdl.map_raw_keys=true

Detection of keyboard type is not supported in SDL. Only standard PC104/105
keyboards used with XFree86 will currently work with raw key-mapping (and for
PPC Macs with ADB keyboards, your kernel must also be configured to generate Linux
keycodes for your keyboard rather than ADB keycodes), since there is no portable
way under SDL to determine the keyboard type at run time.

On BeOS, I recommend always using the raw key-mapping, since SDL's mapping
of raw BeOS keycodes to SDL keysyms isn't complete (if you don't use raw
key-mapping, the Windows keys don't work, for example).


Config file changes
===================

1) Some config file options have been added and others obsoleted in line with
changes in WinUAE 0.8.23. New options include:

synchronize_clock=<true|false>

  Enable/disable the new clock synchronization function. This obsoletes the
  old method of clock synchronization via the tool timehack.

maprom=<?>

  Enable map-rom support within the emulation. This requires a sepecial
  version  of BlizKick. I haven't tested this, so I don't know how or if it
  works  - yet. I'll investigate it for the next release.


The following options have been obsoleted:

  sound_min_buff
  sound_pri_time
  sound_pri_cutoff
  
  
2) On Unix machines (that includes Linux and OS X) the target name in the
config file is now 'unix', rather than 'x11'. Thus, for example, you need to
use 

unix.rom_path=/home/evilrich/amiga/roms/

instead of 'x11.rom_path', etc.

The options specific to the x11 graphics driver are not affected. Thus the
options 'x11.use_mitshm', 'x11.hide_cursor', etc. are all still valid.


3) New Amiga-specific config options.

amiga.screen_type=<custom|public|ask>

  The screen type to open the UAE window on. If 'custom', then UAE will open
  its own (public) screen; if 'public', then UAE will open as a window on a
  (possibly named, see 'amiga.publicscreen' option); or 'ask', then UAE will
  prompt the user to select a screenmode. Defaults to 'public', and unless
  'amiga.publicscreen' is set to the name of a public screen to use, UAE will
  open a window on the default public screen - usually the Workbench.

amiga.use_grey=<true|false>

  Output is render in shades of grey rather than colour. Useful when running
  on a <=8-bit colour public screen with few pens free and you don't want  
  dithered colours. The default is 'false'.
			       
amiga.use_dither=<true|false>

  Output is dithered. Again, useful when you don't have sufficient colours
  available. Dithered output will generally be slower. Defaults to 'true'.

amiga.publicscreen=<name>

  If 'amiga.screen_type' is set to 'public' then open the UAE window on the
  public screen 'name'. If not specified, then use the default public screen. 


4) Comments in the config file are now supported again. Lines beginning with
a '#'  will be ignored.


New Configure option
====================

For those building UAE from source on x86 Unices other than Linux, a new
configure option has been added, --disable-natmem. This will build the JIT
compiler without support for doing direct memory access (the direct memory
system is dependent on Linux segv signal hanlding to trap accesses to
unmapped memory and won't work on other x86 Unices) hopefully allowing the
JIT engine to work on many more platforms.
