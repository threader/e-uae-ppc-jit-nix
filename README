E-UAE 0.8.27
============

This is a version of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation
core based on WinUAE 0.8.27. It attempts to bring many of the great features
of WinUAE to non-Windows platforms. This version now finally has a name,
E-UAE, since that's what everybody was calling it anyway. The 'E' can stand
for anything you fancy. Experimental, extreme, exciting, egalitarian,
eggplant, . . .

Currently it will build and run (with a varying degree of supported
features) on Linux and other Unices, Mac OS X, BeOS and AmigaOS itself
(either for 68k machines or PPC machines with OS4.0). OS X requires either
LibSDL or an X server for graphics output, but native graphics are
supported on AmigaOS and BeOS, although, at the moment, SDL is also
preferred on BeOS since the native driver is incomplete.

E-UAE is open-source software and is made available under the terms of the
GPL. See the COPYING file included with the E-UAE archive for details.

E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors including Bernd Schmidt
(the original author and maintainer of UAE), Bernie Meyer (the author of the
x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the current maintainer of WinUAE), and many
more.

To make full use of E-UAE you will need access to an image of some version
of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM emulation which
may work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted
material and may not be freely distributed (so don't ask me for a copy). If
you don't have an Amiga from which you can legally make a ROM image, a
selection of ROM images are available for purchase online from Cloanto
(publishers of the Amiga Forever distribution). See

What's new since 0.8.25
=======================

General
-------
* Core emulation updated to WinUAE 0.8.27 with bug fixes incorporated from
  later WinUAE versions.
* Improved compatibility with Amiga software.
* Lots of clean up to the code. Builds more cleanly and quickly and requires
  much less memory to do so.
* Bug fixes and speed improvements to the P96 emulation, including fully working
  32-bit modes on big-endian machines.
* Speed improvements and bug fixes when using LibSDL for graphics,
* Better networking support, plus a new bsdsocket emulation from Jeff
  Shepherd based on the WinUAE code. (This doesn't work everywhere yet, so
  the old bsdsocket emulation is still there.)
* Fixed date-stamp discrepancies between host and the emulation when using
  virtual filesystems on (most) Unix-like hosts (it now takes account of local
  timezone).
* Support for SFS-formatted hard files with newer versions of SFS.
* Support for Action Replay cartridge ROMs now enabled.

Unix platforms
--------------
* Many improvements to Gtk+ configuration GUI.
* ALSA sound driver (for Linux). This is based on Heikki Orsila's driver
  from UADE.

OS X
----
* A Cocoa dialog for inserting floppy images has been implemented (thanks to
  Steven J. Saunders).
* SCSI emulation now fully works on OS X.
* Raw key-mapping supported on OS X when using SDL graphics.
* Building against pthreads supported on OS X (and other platforms with
  named semaphores).

BeOS
----
* Partial merge of Axel Doerfler's BeUAE (the BeOS native graphics driver is
  is now mostly working and native BeOS threads are supported).

AmigaOS (and clones)
--------------------

* Sound is now supported in AmigaOS versions (either native Paula or AHI
  sound).
* Many bug fixes and improvements to the AmigaOS gfx driver
  - Requesters now appear on E-UAE screen.
  - Intelligent hiding of host mouse pointer.
* ARexx port supported in AmigaOS versions (and hence the MUIRexx GUI).
* CAPS disk images supported on AmigaOS versions.
* Support for MorphOS and AROS now officially included.

And lots more. See the Changelog for the gory details.


Still to do
===========

The following features of WinUAE are not supported:

* Serial and parallel port emulation.
* AHI soundcard emulation.
* Catweasel support.
* OpenGL rendering and graphics filters.
* Snapshots
* Emulation of a CD32 controller.
* Floppy drive sounds.
* Everything else that I've forgotten about.


Known problems
==============

Some significant misfeatures that I know about and am working to fix:

* Only platforms supporting the GTK+ toolkit have a useable configuration
  GUI (and the GTK+ GUI is still incomplete).
* JIT direct memory access only works on Linux/x86 and due to a limit in
  glibc and the way direct memory is implemented, you can only emulate up to
  32MB of ZIII RAM. Select more than that and the JIT will fall back on
  indirect memory access and hence will be slower.
* Autoscroll screens are broken in Picasso96 emulation.
* Virtual filesystem doesn't support platforms which use UTF-8 for filenames
  (e.g., OS X, Linux with a UTF-8 locale, etc.). Filenames with characters
  outside of the core ASCII range will be mangled.
* Virtual filesystem has a bug which if used to host an IBrowse cache
  causes IBrowse to crash at start-up (temporary solution: use a hardfile
  for IBrowse's cache).
* Hard files are limited to 2GB in size.
* Timing problems occurs on x86 and PPC hosts which employ CPU frequency
  scaling.
* Full documentation is lacking.


Using E-UAE
===========

Documentation is a work-in-progress. See the docs directory.
