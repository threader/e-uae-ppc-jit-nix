2005-01-07 00:45  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Enough! Enough! This is E-UAE 0.8.27 final.

2005-01-07 00:15  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: Don't try to use a HW surface for Amiga
	  screens in SDL gfx driver. This need more testing yet.

2005-01-06 23:02  evi1rich

	* docs/configuration.txt: Updated configuration doc.

2005-01-06 22:21  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-x11/xwin.c: X11 gfx driver now has default settings
	  x11.use_mitshm=true and x11.hide_cursor=true (previously these
	  defaulted to false).

2005-01-06 21:56  evi1rich

	* src/: compemu_raw_x86.c, compemu_support.c, include/compemu.h:
	  Tidied up some compiler warnings when building the JIT.

2005-01-06 21:25  evi1rich

	* src/od-generic/memory.c: Bugger! - and this one too (and this was
	  the important one).

2005-01-06 21:23  evi1rich

	* src/main.c: Missed this file with previous check-in.

2005-01-06 21:21  evi1rich

	* src/: memory.c, include/memory.h, include/sysdeps.h: Cleared out
	  some cruft from the JIT direct-memory system.

2005-01-06 21:18  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Disable building with filesystem threads for now.
	  It hurts performance on most platforms.

2005-01-06 21:12  evi1rich

	* src/expansion.c: Fixed compiler warning.

2005-01-06 02:00  evi1rich

	* src/md-i386-gcc/m68k.h: Tighten constraint on v parameter to i386
	  optimized flag-handling function optflag_addb(). Fixes building
	  with gcc-2.95.

2005-01-04 01:09  evi1rich

	* debian/: control, menu, rules: Debian build scripts should really
	  work again now.

2005-01-04 01:07  evi1rich

	* README: Mention new ALSA driver in user-visible changes in
	  README.

2005-01-03 16:14  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/sd-alsa/Makefile.am,
	  src/sd-alsa/sound.c, src/sd-alsa/sound.h: Applied patch from Kars
	  de Jong which merges Heikki Orsila's ALSA driver from UADE and
	  fixes detection of libscg by the configure script.

2005-01-03 15:02  evi1rich

	* debian/: README, README.Debian, changelog, control: Updated
	  scripts for building Debian package.

2005-01-03 14:45  evi1rich

	* docs/: COMPATIBILITY, CREDITS, FAQ, NEWS, README,
	  README.PROGRAMMERS, bsdsocket.txt, compiling.txt,
	  configuration.txt, floppies.txt, keyboard.txt, scsi.txt: Replaced
	  old UAE documentation with some interim up-to-date documentation.
	  Much more work to do here.

2005-01-03 13:34  evi1rich

	* README: Updated README. Trimmed documentation that will be moved
	  to the docs/ directory. Fixed URL for mailing list.

2005-01-01 23:59  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fixed building JIT compiler when P96 emulation
	  is not being built.

2005-01-01 23:57  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/: Makefile.am, memory.c: Add support for allocating
	  JIT cache on AmigaOS-like hosts. This is only useful on AROS at
	  the moment, since the JIT is currently x86 only.

2004-12-30 04:11  evi1rich

	* src/compemu_support.c: Disabled some JIT warnings that can flood
	  when compforcesettings is not set. They're not terribly helpful.

2004-12-30 04:08  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: In Gtk+ GUI, JIT page was being disabled
	  when 68ec020 CPU was selected.  Fixed. (Ideally, it should
	  disabled the memory-access controls when an 68ec020 is selected,
	  but I'll fix that later.)

2004-12-14 23:09  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Temporarily disabled support for
	  building AmigaOS gfx driver for AROS hosts.  It doesn't currently
	  work on AROS. Also fixed up support for building without CGX
	  again.

2004-12-14 23:07  evi1rich

	* src/main.c: Removed some dead code.

2004-12-14 23:05  evi1rich

	* src/cfgfile.c: Re-implemented -H command-line option on AmigaOS
	  for selecting screen type.

2004-12-14 22:59  evi1rich

	* src/custom.c: Fixed some bugs in the code which dynamically
	  allocates and grows the sprite/color tables for hosts without
	  virtual memory. The sprite tables weren't actually being
	  reallocated! This allows, for example, Sanity's Arte demo to run.
	  Thanks to Thomas Wurgler for reporting the bug.

2004-12-04 02:16  evi1rich

	* src/gfxlib.c: Don't build gfxlib code. This is not even supported
	  via a config option at the moment and, anyway, is of dubious
	  benefit at the moment. Should probaly remove this stuff entirely
	  at some point.

2004-12-04 00:17  evi1rich

	* src/cfgfile.c: Removed some options no longer supported from the
	  help list.

2004-12-03 01:10  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: In AmigaOS gfx driver, if using
	  P96/CGX for output and allocation of the RTG-compatible
	  off-screen buffer fails, then fall back on using graphics.lib for
	  output.

2004-12-03 01:07  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: In AmigaOS gfx driver, when using the
	  delta buffer for output, the delta buffer needs to be cleared
	  when the display is cleared in flush_clear_screen().

2004-12-02 20:50  evi1rich

	* src/sd-amigaos/sound.c: AmigaOS audio driver will now compile
	  again if AHI SDK isn't available.

2004-12-02 20:26  evi1rich

	* src/include/newcpu.h: Added kludge to work around name conflict
	  with the Exception() function on AROS.

2004-12-02 15:51  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: In AmigaOS gfx driver, replaced code
	  to allocate pixbuf for delta output.	Ooops.

2004-12-02 15:46  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: In AmigaOS gfx driver, always set
	  maxblocklines to the screen height so that updates are flushed to
	  screen once per frame. There doesn't appear to be any advantage
	  in its original setting of 100.

2004-12-02 15:12  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: In AmigaOS graphics driver, set
	  SA_ShowTitle as FALSE when opening a custom screen. This was
	  screwing mouse movements. Also only dynamically hide mouse
	  pointer when running in window. On a custom screen, the pointer
	  is now always hiden.

2004-12-01 03:14  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/: UAEGUI.rexx, UAEWB, UAEWB.aux, UAEWB.rexx,
	  ami-rexx.c: A bunch of fixes for the AmigaOS AREXX interface and
	  the MUIRexx GUI. This pretty much all works now apart from the
	  screenmode stuff.

2004-12-01 02:52  evi1rich

	* src/cfgfile.c: Re-implemented -x and -T command-line options for
	  the AmigaOS gfx target. -x disables dithering, while -T enables
	  greyscale mode (both of these options only apply on
	  palette-mapped screens).

2004-12-01 02:24  evi1rich

	* src/: uaeexe.c, include/uaeexe.h: Some tidying up.

2004-12-01 02:22  evi1rich

	* src/cfgfile.c: On Amiga targets default to using joystick 1 for
	  port 1 (not joystick 0, which will be the mouse on a classic
	  Amiga).

2004-12-01 02:18  evi1rich

	* src/: custom.c, drawing.c: Fixed some bugs when using the sprite
	  collision table with OS_WITHOUT_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT defined. Silly
	  me. I can't count. ;-)

2004-11-30 20:54  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/main.c: On AmigaOS targets request minimum stack
	  also when linking against ixemul.

2004-11-30 20:50  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-gui.c: Fixed a malloc() bug in path handling
	  in AmigaOS floppy dialog.

2004-11-30 04:00  tag E-UAE-0_8_27-RC3

2004-11-30 04:00  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Let's call this E-UAE 0.8.27-RC3.

2004-11-30 03:26  evi1rich

	* src/jd-linuxold/joystick.c: Oops. Removed garbage from Linux
	  joystick driver.

2004-11-30 03:20  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Merge simpler AddTail() implementation to P96
	  emulation from WinUAE 0.9.92.

2004-11-30 03:07  evi1rich

	* src/gui-cocoa/cocoaui.m: In Cocoa floppy dialog, add .ZIP, .DMS
	  and .FDI extensions to the file filter.

2004-11-30 03:04  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Simplified PPC assembly byte-swap code in P96
	  emulation.

2004-11-30 02:10  evi1rich

	* src/drawing.c: Removed dead code.

2004-11-30 00:16  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Added a kludge to the Gtk+ GUI to disable
	  JIT page when CPU is using 24-bit addressing.

2004-11-29 23:56  evi1rich

	* src/jd-linuxold/joystick.c: Applied a patch from Nick Seow (with
	  some tidying up) which fixes the Linux joystick driver to look
	  for /dev/input/js* device nodes if no /dev/js* nodes can be
	  found.

2004-11-29 22:25  evi1rich

	* src/include/options.h: Missed checking in this file when applying
	  the fixup_joystick_prefs changes in main.c.

2004-11-29 22:23  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/floppyfileentry.c: Fix set_filename method of the
	  Gtk+ floppyfileentry widget so that the eject widget is correctly
	  enabled or disabled.

2004-11-29 22:06  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: In Gtk+ GUI, kludge the width of the JIT
	  cache size widget. This will go away when the JIT page is
	  redesigned.

2004-11-29 21:43  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: in Gtk+ GUI, disable P96 memory widgets when
	  CPU address range is 24 bits.

2004-11-29 21:25  evi1rich

	* src/main.c: When fixing up preferences, don't allow joyports to
	  be configured to use non-existant host joysticks. Try and replace
	  such settings with a sensible default.

2004-11-29 21:24  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: In Gtk+ GUI on gameport page, disable
	  joysticks options in accordance to the count of joysticks
	  attached to the host.

2004-11-27 17:15  evi1rich

	* src/caps/caps.c: Bump soname of CAPS plugin to load on Linux to
	  version 2.

2004-11-27 16:49  evi1rich

	* src/md-i386-gcc/m68k.h: Fixed building the x86 optimized
	  flag-handling code on GCC 3.4.x. For the cmpb function, GCC can
	  erroneously put the 'd' parameter in %sil or %dil, which are
	  x86-64 registers not found on ia32. IMHO, this is a bug in GCC,
	  but, anyway, this can be avoided by tightening the constraint on
	  the 'd' paramter to use one of the 'q' registers.

2004-11-27 15:25  evi1rich

	* src/jd-sdl/joystick.c: SDL Joystick driver would segfault if
	  initialization failed. Fixed. Also, just initialize it once.

2004-11-27 14:50  evi1rich

	* src/custom.c: Removed a stray #endif left in from debugging.
	  Ooops.

2004-11-27 14:40  evi1rich

	* src/: audio.c, blitter.c, custom.c, disk.c, events.c,
	  include/custom.h, include/options.h: Assorted custom-chip
	  emulation fixed merged from WinUAE 0.9.92. This includes copper
	  and blitter timing fixes, improved blitter slowdown
	  approximation, timing fixes for frame-skipping in cycle-exact
	  mode, vsync fixes, etc.

2004-11-27 14:21  evi1rich

	* src/: gui-muirexx/ami-gui.c, gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c,
	  od-amiga/ami-disk.c: Some fixes for the AmigaOS targets. Don't
	  translate AmigaOS paths to Unix paths (we don't use ixemul -
	  except on MorphOS where libnix is a bit lacking). Display
	  requesters on the process's default window.

2004-11-27 14:10  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Fixed a bug in AmigaOS gfx target,
	  where keys would get "stuck" down when the UAE window loses
	  focus.

2004-11-27 14:05  evi1rich

	* src/gencpu.c: Merged fixed DIVS/DIVU flag handling for 68020+
	  from WinUAE 0.9.90.

2004-11-27 14:02  evi1rich

	* src/newcpu.c: Merged updated 68k exception handling code from
	  WinUAE 0.9.91.

2004-11-25 14:14  evi1rich

	* src/keybuf.c: Accept Right Alt as well as Right Ctrl for
	  firebutton in fake joystick emulation layout 2. Some keyboards,
	  e.g. Amiga keyboards and some laptops, don't have a Right Ctrl
	  key.

2004-11-22 09:10  evi1rich

	* src/newcpu.c: Applied MOVEC fix from WinUAE 0.9.90: access to ISP
	  register is legal on the 68020.

2004-11-17 13:26  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: floppyfileentry.c, floppyfileentry.h: Improvements
	  to the Gtk+ floppy entry widget: use a (non-editable) entry
	  widget to display the floppy image name rather than a plain
	  label; fixed bugs in handling of paths; disable eject widget when
	  there's no image inserted to eject.

2004-11-17 13:21  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: In Gtk+ UI, disable floppy entry widgets for
	  drives that are disabled.

2004-11-15 21:22  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: Removed some debugging statements
	  accidentally left in.

2004-11-15 19:49  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: A bunch of bug fixes and tweaks for the SDL
	  gfx driver. Notably, fixed surface locking, so now that hardware
	  surfaces can be used for Amiga as well as P96 screens.

2004-11-15 19:42  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fixed a bug in the P96 code: the on-screen
	  buffer wasn't being unlocked after flushing pixels.

2004-11-15 08:51  evi1rich

	* src/inputdevice.c: Don't open the floppy dialog for a drive if
	  that drives is not enabled.

2004-11-13 10:53  evi1rich

	* src/drawing.c: When flushing updates to the screen in block mode,
	  treat consecutive lines separated by a single line into a block.
	  This speeds up drawing with scanlines (where only every other
	  line on the screen is updated).

2004-11-12 16:46  evi1rich

	* src/disk.c: Disable support for floppy save images. This wasn't
	  working yet, anyway.

2004-11-12 16:32  evi1rich

	* src/zfile.c: Fixed some compiler warnings.

2004-11-12 11:38  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: floppyfileentry.c, floppyfileentry.h: In Gtk+ GUI,
	  remember last directory used for floppy dialog globally, not
	  indvidually per drive.

2004-11-12 11:18  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/md-68k/m68k.h: Re-worked 68k optimized flag
	  handling and added configure support for building with optimized
	  flags on 68k targets.

2004-11-12 11:06  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/gencpu.c, src/sysconfig.h.in:
	  Added support for building with optimized flag handling on x86
	  and PPC targets.

2004-11-12 09:44  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Build on OS X/Darwin with the -mdynamic-no-pic
	  switch to turn off the generation of position-independent code
	  (which is - go figure - the default). We don't need it and
	  leaving it on leads to flabby and slow code (especially in the
	  CPU emulation).

2004-11-12 09:26  evi1rich

	* src/serial.c: When serial emulation is built with no back-end,
	  always claim that there is space in the serial buffer to send
	  data (when, actually, there isn't even a buffer!). This allows,
	  for example, Skidmarks to work.

2004-11-12 09:20  evi1rich

	* src/: custom.c, serial.c, include/serial.h: Merged serial port
	  emulation from WinUAE 0.9.91. I have not implemented any
	  back-ends for this yet, so this isn't actually very useful yet.
	  However, it may make software that tries to use the serial port
	  play nicer.

2004-11-04 08:53  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Build with big-endian IEEE fpu code on PowerPC
	  targets.

2004-11-04 08:45  evi1rich

	* src/: memory.c, gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Some more tweaks for
	  MorphOS from Morgoth.

2004-11-04 08:36  evi1rich

	* src/sd-amigaos/sound.c: Fix up AmigaOS sound driver for MorphOS.
	  Thanks to Morgoth again.

2004-11-04 08:02  evi1rich

	* src/caps/caps.c: Simplified conditional compilation of
	  AmigaOS-specific CAPS code.

2004-11-04 07:44  evi1rich

	* src/td-amigaos/thread.c: Fix AmigaOS thread support on MorphOS.
	  MorphOS needs to be explicitly told that a new thread use PPC
	  code (otherwise it defaults to 68k). Thanks to Marcin 'Morgoth'
	  Kurek for the pointer.

2004-11-04 07:02  evi1rich

	* src/md-ppc-gcc/m68k.h: Work-around for compiling the PPC
	  optimized flag handling code with GCC 2.95.

2004-10-30 11:02  evi1rich

	* src/: newcpu.c, include/newcpu.h: Some tidying up.

2004-10-30 11:01  evi1rich

	* src/: custom.c, drawing.c, main.c, include/custom.h,
	  include/drawing.h: On targets with OS_WITHOUT_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT
	  defined (e.g., AmigaOS-like targets) allocate the sprite
	  collision table spixels dynamically rather than statically at
	  load time. This shaves another 10 megs of the BSS size on
	  AmigaOS. Also cleaned up the handling of the sprite table
	  allocation, and added some checks.

2004-10-28 09:57  evi1rich

	* src/md-ppc-gcc/m68k.h: Reworked ppc-gcc CCR flags handling and
	  implemented optimized flag evaluation code.

2004-10-28 09:56  evi1rich

	* src/md-i386-gcc/m68k.h: Cleaned up and tweaked i386-gcc CCR flags
	  implementation and the optimized flag evaluation code.

2004-10-28 09:27  evi1rich

	* src/: memory.c, include/memory.h: Don't use memory baseaddr table
	  if not building JIT - it's not currently needed.

2004-10-28 09:03  evi1rich

	* src/: identify.c, include/identify.h: Fixed compiler warnings,
	  plus made the identify tables read-only.

2004-10-26 04:23  evi1rich

	* src/Makefile.am: Bugger! Build scripts still weren't running make
	  dist in src/od-macosx.  Really fixed now!

2004-10-26 01:34  tag E-UAE-0_8_27-RC2

2004-10-26 01:34  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Let's call this E-UAE 0.8.27-RC2.

2004-10-26 01:33  evi1rich

	* src/md-i386-gcc/support.c: Removed some debugging output that got
	  left in accidentally.

2004-10-26 00:39  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: In the SDL gfx driver, don't use
	  SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen. Always close existing window/screen and
	  open a new screen/window. This seems more robust and less prone
	  to the vagaries of X window managers.

2004-10-26 00:23  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Check whether binary is running with SUID
	  bit and if so don't try and start Gtk+ GUI. This allows a binary
	  with Gtk+ GUI built in to work with SUID.

2004-10-26 00:21  evi1rich

	* src/main.c: Output version to log when starting. Could do with
	  outputting more info here to make debug logs easier to use.

2004-10-25 23:19  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/od-macosx/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-macosx/bin/Makefile.am, src/od-macosx/lib/Makefile.am:
	  Glue for building against SDL framework on OS X was not being
	  included with the distribution tarball. Fixed.

2004-10-25 22:26  evi1rich

	* src/: newcpu.c, compemu_support.c, gencomp.c, gencpu.c,
	  include/newcpu.h: Separated cputbl type into two structs: cputbl
	  and comptbl. This uses less memory and allows code to be
	  simplified in a couple of places. While we're at it, made the
	  tables based on these types read-only.

2004-10-25 22:09  evi1rich

	* src/ar.c: Turned off debugging output in Action Replay emulation.

2004-10-25 22:08  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Fixed typo in configure script.

2004-10-25 21:54  evi1rich

	* src/memory.c: Argh! I fixed the Kickstart emulation, but the
	  loading of Kick images broke.  Now both work again.

2004-10-25 21:36  evi1rich

	* src/memory.c: Kickstart replacement was broken. Fixed.

2004-10-25 20:23  evi1rich

	* src/drawing.c: Fixed a bug in the drawing initialization code.
	  This could cause a segfault when called before the screen had
	  been properly set up. Thanks to Paul Laycock for reporting the
	  bug.

2004-10-24 04:57  evi1rich

	* src/main.c: Merge with WinUAE 0.8.27 broke selecting 'Reset' in
	  Gtk+ GUI to start. This is the easy fix. A better idea would be
	  making the GUI fully aware of UAE's state and disabling the reset
	  button when UAE isn't running. I'll save that for later, though.

2004-10-19 03:02  evi1rich

	* configure.in: A configure fix for systems that cannot include
	  sys/mount.h without sys/param.h (e.g. NetBSD 2.0). Thanks to
	  Bernhard Moellemann for reporting this.

2004-10-18 23:16  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/memory.h: Now the sprite bug is fixed, go back to
	  compiling on OS4.0 with OS_WITHOUT_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT defined
	  (this knocks 10MB off the BSS size).

2004-10-18 23:14  evi1rich

	* src/custom.c: Fixed a bug that was breaking the low-memory build
	  of the sprite tables.

2004-10-18 23:13  evi1rich

	* src/keymap/keymap.c: Fixed a bug in the keymap code which could
	  cause a segfault at start-up.

2004-10-17 02:50  tag E-UAE-0_8_27-RC1

2004-10-17 02:50  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: chipsettypepanel.c, chipsettypepanel.h: Forgot to
	  check in some new files for Gtk+ UI. Fixed.

2004-10-17 02:23  evi1rich

	* configure.in: This is now E-UAE 0.8.27-RC1.

2004-10-17 02:12  evi1rich

	* README: Added sections about bsdsocket emulation and compiling
	  against SDL framework on OS X to README.

2004-10-17 02:11  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Added rudimentary configure support for building
	  Cocoa UI on OS X.

2004-10-15 02:53  evi1rich

	* src/od-macosx/: bin/README, bin/sdl-config, lib/README,
	  lib/SDLMain.h, lib/SDLmain.m, lib/build.sh: Added glue in
	  src/od-macosx for compiling against the SDL framework on OSX
	  (rather than the Fink's build of SDL).

2004-10-15 01:56  evi1rich

	* src/md-ppc-gcc/exectasks.h: Adapted PPC stack magic code to
	  compile on other GCC versions other than Apple's.

2004-10-13 07:34  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: More clean-up in Gtk+ UI.

2004-10-13 05:58  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: Makefile.am, chipsetspeedpanel.c,
	  chipsetspeedpanel.h, floppyfileentry.c, gtkui.c, util.c, util.h:
	  Reworked chipset page in Gtk+ UI plus general tidying up and
	  removing of dead code.

2004-10-08 01:42  evi1rich

	* src/: fsusage.c, gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c, gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c,
	  od-amiga/ami-disk.c: Some clean-ups for AmigaOS targets.

2004-10-08 00:51  evi1rich

	* src/sysconfig.h.in: Urgh! Actually it appears src/sysconfig.h.in
	  should be here, since aclocal doesn't want to generate if it's
	  missing.

2004-10-08 00:47  evi1rich

	* src/sysconfig.h.in: Removed src/sysconfig.h.in template from CVS.
	  It doesn't need to be here since it's automatically generated.

2004-10-08 00:34  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/md-i386-gcc/support.c,
	  src/md-ppc-gcc/support.c: Added support for calibrating x86
	  processor clock on systems without alarm() or setitimer(). Also
	  added configure support for detecting alarm() and sync().

2004-10-08 00:22  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Added configure support for AROS target.

2004-10-08 00:21  evi1rich

	* Makefile.am: Fix for build scripts to include m4 directory when
	  automatically regenerating configure script.

2004-10-06 04:07  evi1rich

	* src/: bsdsocket-posix-new.c, bsdsocket-posix.c: Fix for both
	  bsdsocket emulation flavours: handle platforms that don't have
	  IPPROTO_IPIP and IPPROTO_TP when mapping sockopts. Thanks to
	  Fredrik Strandberg for reporting this problem.

2004-10-06 04:01  evi1rich

	* src/: gfx-sdl/rawkeys.c, gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c, gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.h,
	  gfx-beos/be-Input.cpp, keymap/beos_rawkeys.c,
	  keymap/beos_rawkeys.h, keymap/keymap.c, keymap/keymap.h,
	  keymap/keymap_common.h, keymap/quartz_rawkeys.c,
	  keymap/quartz_rawkeys.h, keymap/x11pc_rawkeys.c,
	  keymap/x11pc_rawkeys.h: Began clean-up of support for raw key
	  mapping.

2004-10-04 21:10  evi1rich

	* src/custom.c: Applied a blitter timing fix from the Maestro, Toni
	  Wilen. This fixes graphics corruption in, for example, the Desert
	  Dream demo.

2004-10-04 21:08  evi1rich

	* src/newcpu.c: Fixed a segfault which occurred when dumping CPU
	  state after a panic.

2004-10-03 21:42  evi1rich

	* README: Added more information to README.

2004-10-03 21:37  evi1rich

	* src/: gfx-sdl/sdlkeys.c, gfx-x11/x11keys.c,
	  keymap/hotkeys_common.h: Added hotkey (F12+F) for Action Replay
	  freeze button to remaining gfx targets.

2004-10-03 21:30  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Fixed a typo in the AmigaOS gfx driver
	  mouse grab code and added a hot-key combination for the Action
	  Replay freeze button.

2004-10-03 20:45  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Added support for new OS4.0
	  WA_MouseLimits tag to mouse grab code in AmigaOS gfx driver to
	  limit the grabbed pointer to the inner window.

2004-09-28 22:09  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Moved P96 memory settings widgets from gfx
	  page to memory page in Gtk+ UI.

2004-09-28 21:41  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Fixed a bug which causing the Gtk+ GUI to
	  not cleanly close.

2004-09-28 04:14  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/ar.c: Added support for
	  building the Action Replay cartridge emulation.

2004-09-28 04:13  evi1rich

	* README: Some minor tweaks to the README.

2004-09-27 08:17  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Added support for grabbing input focus
	  in AmigaOS gfx target when built for OS4.0.

2004-09-27 08:16  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Some minor tidying up in the build
	  scripts.

2004-09-25 12:30  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Improved host pointer hiding in
	  windowed mode for AmigaOS gfx target. As well as checking the
	  window bounds, also check whether the window is obscured by
	  another window at the pointer position.

2004-09-22 20:34  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/main.c: Fixed compiler warning (missing header
	  included).

2004-09-22 20:32  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: Added some work-arounds for using the SDL
	  gfx driver on AmigaOS4.0. Hardware surfaces are problematic there
	  at the moment.

2004-09-22 20:29  evi1rich

	* src/include/sleep.h: Now that the culprit of the timing problems
	  on OS4.0 has been identified and it's not the timing code,
	  re-instate use of TimeDelay() for sleeping on OS4.0. Also, prefer
	  this to SDL_TimeDelay() when building against SDL (since the SDL
	  version busy-waits).

2004-09-22 20:26  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/memory.h: Don't define OS_WITHOUT_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT
	  for just now when building for AmigaOS4.0, because this (for same
	  reason yet to be fathomed) causes huge slow-downs with sprite
	  rendering (or possibly sprite-sprite collision detection) in real
	  CPU mode. Needs investigation...

2004-09-16 08:09  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Replaced host mouse-pointer hiding
	  behaviour for AmigaOS gfx driver. Now it will completely blank
	  the pointer when using a custom screen or when the pointer is
	  inside the UAE window when running in a window. When the host
	  pointer is moved outside of the window, the default pointer image
	  will re-appear.  This cures the annoying and disorientating
	  "loss" of the pointer when running in windowed mode. The code add
	  needs tidying up, but that can wait until the AmigaOS gfx driver
	  itself is re-worked (after the next release).

2004-09-16 02:24  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-x11/xwin.c: Fixed a typo introduced in a recent change in
	  the X11 driver which was causing the UAE window not to be closed
	  (causing extra windows to be created when P96 was opened, on
	  resolution changes, etc...).

2004-09-15 08:04  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c: Fix up UAE side of MUIRexx GUI so
	  that it compiles when SDL graphics driver is used.

2004-09-13 11:48  evi1rich

	* src/filesys_unix.c: Fixed typo in conditional inclusion of
	  sys/statvfs.h was causing problems on FreeBSD (and probably
	  elsewhere). Thanks to Simon Dick for reporting the problem.

2004-09-10 22:11  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: floppyfileentry.c, floppyfileentry.h, gtkui.c:
	  Re-implemented a title string for the insert floppy file dialogs
	  in the Gtk+ GUI. This was another feature that Martin's re-write
	  didn't posses.

2004-09-10 00:18  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Fixed a bug in the Gtk+ UI that was causing
	  boot priority value to be ignored when adding a new virtual
	  filesystem.

2004-09-09 22:19  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/floppyfileentry.c: Fix for building Gtk+ UI with GCC
	  2.95.

2004-09-09 21:47  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix.c: Fix for building on GCC-2.95.

2004-09-09 21:36  evi1rich

	* src/newcpu.c: Fixed the problem of UAE segfaulting when started
	  with more than 32MB of Z3 memory. This was because of the NATMEM
	  system failing to allocate a chunk this large and turning off
	  direct-memory access. The JIT, however, was not noticing this and
	  still trying to use direct-memory. Solution: force a re-check of
	  the JIT settings before starting the CPU emulation proper.

2004-09-09 02:02  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/UAEWB: Modified UAEWB start-up script for MUIRexx
	  GUI. Don't fail on errors and don't check for ixemul.library
	  (which isn't necessary with this version of UAE).

2004-09-09 01:59  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c: Updated VERSION ARexx command for
	  MUIRexx GUI to return current information.

2004-09-09 01:28  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Started to sort out the mess that is
	  the AmigaOS graphics driver. Re-wrote the code to open UAE on a
	  custom screen, preferably using the best RTG screen-mode that is
	  available. Lots more work to do here, cleaning up, removing
	  duplicate code, etc.

2004-09-08 21:11  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/main.c: Don't set minimum stack when building on
	  OS4.0 yet because this appears to be broken in current clib2.
	  Need to check this...

2004-09-08 21:08  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c: Re-enabled FAKEJOYSTICK ARexx command
	  for MUIRexx GUI to stop it complaining. It's a no-op for now,
	  though.

2004-09-08 21:06  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Re-enable frame counter in AmigaOS
	  graphics driver. This is used by the MUIRexx GUI to display the
	  FPS rate.

2004-09-08 20:40  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/: ami-gui.c, ami-rexx.c: Fix-up UAE-side of the
	  MUIRexx GUI. Now works on OS4.0 too.

2004-09-08 00:55  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/main.c: Support stack enlargement on AmigaOS 4
	  hosts.

2004-09-08 00:55  evi1rich

	* src/Makefile.am: Add new bsdsocket emulation
	  bsdsocket-posix-new.c to the distribution tarball.

2004-09-07 23:37  evi1rich

	* src/compemu_support.c: More tidying up of log messages.

2004-09-07 23:01  evi1rich

	* src/: od-amiga/main.c, targets/t-amiga.h: Added AmigaOS-specific
	  logging calls which don't log to stderr when UAE is launched from
	  WB.

2004-09-07 22:59  evi1rich

	* src/compemu_fpp.c: Implemented flush_log() call.

2004-09-07 22:58  evi1rich

	* src/: compemu_raw_x86.c, fpp.c, sleep.c, writelog.c,
	  include/sysdeps.h, md-i386-gcc/support.c, md-ppc-gcc/support.c,
	  targets/t-beos.h, targets/t-unix.h: Implemented flush_log() call,
	  plus some random tidying up of log messages.

2004-09-07 16:16  evi1rich

	* src/: cfgfile.c, targets/t-amiga.h, targets/t-beos.h,
	  targets/t-unix.h: Allow target-specific default paths (floppy
	  path, rom path, etc) and support substitution of '~' for home
	  directory in these paths. AmigaOS target now defaults to paths
	  'roms', 'floppies' and 'hardfiles' relative to PROGDIR:, others
	  default to home directory for now.

2004-09-07 16:09  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Use PACKAGE_NAME macro for window and dialog
	  title, etc. rather than hard coding these as "UAE".

2004-09-07 16:06  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Let's call this E-UAE, since that's what
	  everybody's calling it anyway.

2004-09-07 16:05  evi1rich

	* src/: main.c, gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c, gfx-beos/be-Window.cpp,
	  gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c, gfx-x11/xwin.c: Use PACKAGE_NAME macro for
	  window and dialog titles, etc. rather than hard-coding them as
	  "UAE".

2004-09-07 15:47  evi1rich

	* src/memory.c: Tried to make failure to load a Kickstart image
	  more robust and predictable.	Only use Kickstart emulation, if no
	  image is specified - not simply if an image fails to load. Also,
	  if decoding of encrypted images or the check-summing of an image
	  fails, then fail and restart UAE with GUI - don't try and
	  continue with a non-functional Kickstart image.

2004-09-07 15:38  evi1rich

	* src/newcpu.c: Try to restart UAE after putting up the "Kickstart
	  requires a 68020" requester.

2004-09-07 11:22  evi1rich

	* src/Makefile.am: Clean-up of main makefile. Should now behave
	  better under parallel make, but still doesn't scale well. Need a
	  better approach.

2004-09-07 09:34  evi1rich

	* README: Updated README file.

2004-09-07 09:22  evi1rich

	* src/ersatz.c: If Kickstart emulation fails, allow UAE to restart
	  rather than abort (changes merged from WiUAE 0.9.90).

2004-09-07 09:11  evi1rich

	* src/: main.c, gui-cocoa/cocoaui.m, gui-none/nogui.c,
	  gui-beos/gui.cpp: Fixes for re-starting UAE. If a restart is
	  called with an attempt to force the config GUI to open (e.g., due
	  to some fatal config problem) and we cannot display a config GUI
	  (perhaps because we don't have one) then simply exit.

2004-09-07 09:07  evi1rich

	* src/memory.c: Using a host Kickstart ROM on AmigaOS broke with
	  the WinUAE 0.8.27 merge.  Fixed. Also, when loading a Kickstart
	  image file, don't try alternative hard-coded locations. This
	  isn't the place to do this.

2004-09-07 09:03  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Fixes for starting and tearing-down the Gtk+
	  GUI. Now works when UAE proper is restarted.

2004-09-07 08:49  evi1rich

	* src/disk.c: Fix for restarting the floppy emulation.

2004-09-07 08:48  evi1rich

	* src/: gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c, gfx-x11/xwin.c: Fixes for restarting the
	  X11 and SDL graphics drivers.

2004-09-07 08:46  evi1rich

	* src/: md-i386-gcc/support.c, md-ppc-gcc/support.c: On x86 and PPC
	  machines, don't re-do the timing tests when restarting UAE.

2004-09-07 08:43  evi1rich

	* src/include/sleep.h: Using TimeDelay() for sleeping on AmigaOS 4
	  has unpredictable results it seems. Go back to using Delay() for
	  now, until I implement a better solution.

2004-09-06 05:18  evi1rich

	* src/memory.c: Fixed a bug introduced with the WinUAE 0.8.27 merge
	  that was stopping the Kickstart emulation working.

2004-09-04 03:06  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Added automake support for cocoa
	  GUI (configure support still to come). Also started to tidy up
	  configure script. Attempted to stop results from individual tests
	  polluting each other. This solves the problem building against
	  libscg and the SDL framework on OS X. It'll also probably make
	  configuring slightly faster on slow machines. Much more work top
	  be done here...

2004-08-28 11:42  evi1rich

	* src/gui-cocoa/: Makefile.am, cocoaui.m: Added the beginnings of
	  Cocoa GUI for OS X from Steven Saunders. Just disk swapping and
	  alert dialogs for now, but it's a good start! Configure support
	  still to do.

2004-08-28 11:31  evi1rich

	* configure.in, m4/as-objc.m4: Added configure support for
	  detecting Objective C compiler (borrowing an m4 script from the
	  GStreamer project).

2004-08-28 11:22  evi1rich

	* src/filesys.c: Another go at fixing the datestamp issue with the
	  virtual filesystem. The previous attempt wasn't taking account of
	  DST when convert to an Amiga time to a host time. This is now
	  fixed. We still need a more portable way of doing these
	  conversions, however.

2004-08-05 04:10  evi1rich

	* src/: compemu_support.c, od-beos/Makefile.am, od-beos/memory.c,
	  od-generic/Makefile.am, od-generic/memory.c,
	  od-linux/Makefile.am, od-linux/memory.c: Split out JIT cache
	  allocation from core code and add platform-specific
	  implementations.

2004-08-05 03:58  evi1rich

	* src/compemu_support.c: Typo in previous fix broken JIT natmem
	  translation. Fixed.

2004-08-05 01:59  evi1rich

	* src/gencpu.c: Removed some more obsolete code.

2004-08-04 17:13  evi1rich

	* src/blkdev.c: Rename ioctl global back to have_ioctl to avoid
	  conflict on BeOS. This got broken when merging with WinUAE
	  0.8.27.

2004-08-04 17:03  evi1rich

	* src/compemu_support.c: Merging with WinUAE 0.8.27 broke JIT when
	  built without natmem translation.  Trivial fix.

2004-08-04 14:43  evi1rich

	* src/targets/t-unix.h: On OS X, default config file name should be
	  "default.uaerc" since dot files don't show up in Finder. (I
	  previously did this by defining OPTIONSFILENAME when configuring
	  on OS X, but this is now done automagically.)

2004-08-04 14:08  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-gui.c: Fixes for MUIRexx GUI interface so
	  that it can be used with the SDL gfx target.

2004-08-04 14:06  evi1rich

	* src/include/picasso96.h: Fix for building P96 emulation on an
	  AmigaOS target.

2004-08-04 14:05  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fix for PPC inline assembly code so that it'll
	  compile with GCC on OS X and elsewhere. Ugh!

2004-08-04 02:19  evi1rich

	* src/: blkdev-libscg.c, cfgfile.c, include/options.h: Added
	  scsi_device config file option which specifies the name of the
	  SCSI device or SCSI bus to use with the SCSI emulation. This is
	  currently supported by the libscg back-end and will be passed
	  verbatim to libscg. The UAE_SCSI_DEVICE env variable is still
	  supported and will override the scsi_device option if present.
	  Example usage: set to 'ATAPI' to use the Linux-2.6 ATA packet
	  interface; set to 'IOCompactDiscServices/0' to use the first
	  CD-ROM drive on OS X.

2004-08-04 01:16  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Let's call this 0.8.27 now.

2004-08-04 01:02  evi1rich

	* src/sd-sdl/sound.c: Applied fix for 8-bit SDL sound from Heikki
	  Orsila.

2004-08-04 00:49  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/main.c: Add support for SDL in AmigaOS target.

2004-08-04 00:43  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/cputypepanel.c: Added support for selecting 68060
	  processor in GTK+ GUI.

2004-08-04 00:28  evi1rich

	* src/memory.c: Only use host Kickstart ROM on 'classic' AmigaOS -
	  not OS4.0 or MorphOS.

2004-08-04 00:03  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: Debug-logging of key-presses was
	  accidentally left in. Fixed.

2004-08-03 23:39  evi1rich

	* src/: blkdev.c, bsdsocket-posix.c, bsdsocket.c, compemu_fpp.c,
	  compemu_raw_x86.c, compemu_support.c, gencomp.c, gencpu.c,
	  hardfile.c, inputdevice.c, inputevents.def, keybuf.c, missing.c,
	  newcpu.c, savestate.c, scsiemul.c, uaelib.c, unzip.c, zfile.c,
	  gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c, gfx-beos/be-Input.cpp, gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c,
	  gfx-sdl/sdlkeys.c, gfx-x11/x11keys.c, gfx-x11/xwin.c,
	  include/bsdsocket.h, include/cpu_prefetch.h, include/events.h,
	  include/gfxfilter.h, include/keyboard.h, include/newcpu.h,
	  include/unzip.h, include/xwin.h, include/zfile.h,
	  keymap/hotkeys_common.h: Final sync with WinUAE 0.8.27 plus some
	  tidying up.

2004-08-03 23:31  evi1rich

	* src/main.c: Added support for scsilog command-line parameter
	  which enables - surprise, surprise - debug logging for the SCSI
	  emulation.

2004-08-03 21:15  evi1rich

	* src/debug.c: Debuffer memory access routines need to have
	  REGPARAM2 attribute. Fixed.

2004-08-03 15:18  evi1rich

	* src/newcpu.c: Fixed broken interrupt-handling. The new interrupt
	  code was not servicing interrupts when built without JIT support.

	* src/: custom.c, newcpu.c, include/newcpu.h: Merged new interrupt
	  handling code from WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-08-03 13:47  evi1rich

	* src/: gfx-sdl/rawkeys.c, gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c, gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.h,
	  keymap/Makefile.am, keymap/keymap.c, keymap/keymap.h,
	  keymap/quartz_rawkeys.c, keymap/quartz_rawkeys.h,
	  keymap/x11pc_rawkeys.c, keymap/x11pc_rawkeys.h: Add modifier_hack
	  support to SDL gfx driver (and to the keymap layer). Also laid
	  some groundwork for eventually tidying up keymap layer.

2004-08-03 13:04  evi1rich

	* src/keymap/: quartz_rawkeys.c, quartz_rawkeys.h: Fix up Quartz
	  raw key handling.

2004-08-01 10:30  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/filesys.c, src/sysconfig.h.in: Back out option
	  of using the SYSV global timezone for computing local date-stamps
	  on files in the virtual filesystem. The timezone global gives
	  only the offset to UTC from the primary timezone (it doesn't
	  account for DST), plus configure support was broken on *BSD
	  anyway (where there's a timezone() function).

2004-08-01 10:27  evi1rich

	* src/: akiko.c, cia.c: Fixed broken usage of REGPARAM macro.

2004-08-01 10:23  evi1rich

	* src/include/sysdeps.h: Fix for using REGPARAM macro on GCC 3.4.x.

2004-07-31 22:11  evi1rich

	* m4/ac_var_timezone_externals.m4: Forgot to check in
	  ac_var_timezone_externals.m4 file. This is required for configure
	  support for the timzone fix in the virtual filesystem.

2004-07-31 02:07  evi1rich

	* src/: custom.c, include/custom.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-07-31 01:37  evi1rich

	* src/: blitter.c, custom.c, include/blitter.h: Sync with WinUAE
	  0.8.27.

2004-07-31 01:16  evi1rich

	* src/: custom.c, picasso96.c, include/picasso96.h: Sync with
	  WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-07-31 00:58  evi1rich

	* src/: memory.c, gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c, include/autoconf.h,
	  include/blkdev.h, include/memory.h, include/newcpu.h,
	  include/savestate.h, include/scsidev.h, include/sysdeps.h: Sync

	* src/: drawing.c, include/drawing.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-07-30 23:52  evi1rich

	* src/: ar.c, compemu_fpp.c, driveclick.c, expansion.c,
	  filesys.asm, fpp.c, inputdevice.c, include/inputdevice.h,
	  include/keybuf.h: Synced with WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-07-30 21:39  evi1rich

	* src/: audio.c, debug.c, identify.c, include/debug.h,
	  include/identify.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-07-30 21:02  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/filesys.c, src/sysconfig.h.in: Fix for
	  date-stamps on files in the virtual filesystem on Unix systems.
	  When the local timezone was not UTC, the date-stamp on files was
	  not being converted to the local timezone. This fix may need to
	  be applied elsewhere.  I need to verify which systems return a
	  local date-stamp when stat()ing a file.

2004-07-30 20:58  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: cpuspeedpanel.c, gtkui.c: In Gtk+ GUI, handle
	  change of Dont busy wait widget with a separate signal.  This
	  fixes problem with this widget being incorrectly initialized.

2004-07-30 15:31  evi1rich

	* src/: filesys.c, hardfile.c, include/filesys.h: Applied a patch
	  from Toni Wilen which implements the TD_GETGEOMETRY command for
	  hardfiles (and cleans up some other bits and pieces). This fixes
	  support for using the latest versions of SmartFilesystem with
	  hardfiles.

2004-07-28 23:48  evi1rich

	* src/cia.c: Applied patch from Toni Wilen which should fix
	  problems with clock synchronization.

2004-07-28 21:21  evi1rich

	* src/caps/caps.c: Added support for using the m68k-amigaos CAPS
	  plug-in on OS4.0. At the moment I have integrated the emulator
	  stubs for calling the CAPS routines into UAE. These should really
	  be in a stand-alone shared library (and thus transparent to UAE),
	  but I haven't been able to get that to work so far.

2004-07-28 21:02  evi1rich

	* src/sd-amigaos/sound.c: Clear linkio when shutting down AmigaOS
	  sound driver. Fixes problems when restarting the audio system
	  (e.g. after a config change).

2004-07-12 13:10  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: New cfgfile API broke saving config files.
	  Fixed (although it doesn't yet support the separate host and VM
	  configs).

2004-07-12 13:08  evi1rich

	* src/: cfgfile.c, filesys.c, main.c, include/filesys.h,
	  include/options.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-06-27 23:56  evi1rich

	* src/: main.c, od-amiga/main.c, od-amiga/support.c,
	  targets/t-amiga.h: Removed osdep_init() hack in main.c. It was
	  only used to set up timer.device on 68k Amigas. This is now
	  implemented from od-amiga/main.c.

2004-06-27 23:10  evi1rich

	* amiga/source/bsdsocket.e, src/bsdsocket-posix.c: Another attempty
	  to get the old bsdsocket code to work.  1) Took out the abort
	  lock. Didn't work here either.  2) Merged some of Jeff's code
	  from the new bsdsocket handler for mapping socket options and
	  errnos.  3) Implemented new setsocketopt based on the Jeff's
	  code.  4) Tidied up WaitSelect().  5) Fixed amiga-side of
	  WaitSelect(). When the select returns positive, we must return no
	  signals.

	  Hey. AmTelnet now works. :-)

2004-06-27 22:03  evi1rich

	* src/: bsdsocket-posix-new.c, bsdsocket.c, include/bsdsocket.h:
	  Merged latest bsdsocket-new patch from Jeff Shepherd. In Jeff's
	  words: 1> Mostly debug lines. They help me debug problems 2>
	  Fixed a bug in host_gethostbynameaddr where the addrtype wasn't
	  being passed to the socket thread.  3> Implemented
	  getprotobynumber by splitting the common code out of
	  getprotobyname.  4> Close all the open sockets when the library
	  closes.  5> Don't call shutdown on any socket unless explicitly
	  asked to. If you shutdown a socket waiting for accept, any socket
	  that was dup'ed from that socket will now fail their accept calls
	  with EINVAL as the errno.  6> Fixed a bug in getsockopt.  7>
	  Implemented SetDTableSize.  8> Implemented locksigqueue,
	  unlocksigqueue things.

2004-06-25 03:08  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Added configure support for building FDI support
	  with the config option --enable-fdi (now that FDI is a
	  compile-time option). It is enabled by default.

2004-06-25 03:05  evi1rich

	* src/: fdi2raw.c, include/fdi2raw.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27.

2004-06-25 01:07  evi1rich

	* src/include/sleep.h: Added trivial implementation of uae_msleep()
	  for AmigaOS using the amiga.lib TimeDelay() fn. Why didn't I
	  think of that before?

2004-06-25 01:01  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Fixed gfx-amigaos implementation of
	  flush_clear_screen(). It now properly clears based on the window
	  size, rather than the size of the UAE display area. Also, when
	  opening a user screen and the UAE display area is smaller than
	  the screen, centre the display on the screen.

2004-06-20 03:52  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-beos/be-UAE.cpp: Removed duplicate debuggable and
	  mousehack fns from BeOS graphics driver.

2004-06-20 03:29  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/gfx-beos/be-UAE.cpp, src/od-beos/main.cpp,
	  src/gfx-beos/be-UAE.h, src/gfx-beos/be-Window.cpp,
	  src/gfx-beos/be-Window.h, src/gfx-beos/beos.cpp: A first cut at
	  getting Axel's BeOS graphcis driver to work, adapting to the
	  changes since 0.8.17. No P96 as yet, and lots of work to do.

2004-06-20 02:58  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-beos/: be-Input.cpp, be-Input.h: Adapt BeOS gfx driver to
	  new current input API and remove joystick code (which is now
	  handled by a separate joystick driver).

2004-06-20 02:45  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-beos/: Makefile.am, be-Input.cpp, be-Input.h, be-UAE.cpp,
	  be-UAE.h, be-Window.cpp, be-Window.h: Added Axel's BeOS graphics
	  driver from BeUAE (Note this doesn't work yet).

2004-06-20 02:41  evi1rich

	* src/md-generic/exectasks.h: Fixed typo in dummy generic stack
	  magic stuff. Thanks to Uwe Pannecke for spotting this.

2004-06-20 02:39  evi1rich

	* src/jd-beos/joystick.cpp: Added missing
	  get_joystick_widget_type() function to BeOS joystick driver.

2004-06-20 02:26  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Config script wasn't exporting $JOYLIBS to
	  Makefiles. Fixes building of BeOS joystick driver.

2004-06-16 12:01  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: A stray character crept into the code.
	  Fixed.

2004-06-16 11:13  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Merged some more of Jeff's work on the
	  new bsdsocket code. This adds null pointer checks to the
	  copysockaddr_x functions and fixes a problem when copying the
	  sockaddr when doing a recvfrom.

2004-06-16 03:35  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Fixed breakage on GCC-2.95 in new
	  bsdsocket code.

2004-06-16 03:31  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Applied patch from Jeff Shepherd to
	  tidy up the handling of the select abort mechanism in the new
	  bsdsocket code.

2004-06-16 03:05  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Applied patch from Jeff Shepherd which
	  adds supports for a whole raft of extra socket options to the new
	  bsdsocket code.

2004-06-16 02:29  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Applied patch from Jeff Shepherd which
	  fixes problems in the emulation of blocking socket calls in the
	  new bsdsocket code. This is similar to what I did in the old
	  code, but implemented slightly differently. Don't select on read
	  for recv and accept calls and don't select on write for send and
	  connect calls. This speeds things up and cures bogus accepts,
	  etc.

2004-06-16 02:14  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: I've finally cracked the WaitSelect
	  problem in the new bsdsocket code - I think. When doing the wait
	  on the 68k side, multiple signals can arrive at the same time.
	  The trick seems to be if both the signal we're WaitSelecting on
	  and a signal that the sockets we're selecting on arrive at the
	  same time - then use this as a sign the thread has done the
	  select and don't bother waiting for it to finish. Fingers crossed
	  -  this seems to cure all the deadlock problems (and no
	  semaphores required ;-).

2004-06-16 00:45  evi1rich

	* src/: bsdsocket-posix-new.c, include/bsdsocket.h: Removed the
	  abort lock from the new bsdsocket code. It was causing more
	  problems than it was solving.

2004-06-15 22:14  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Applied a patch from Jeff Shepherd
	  which fixes a bug in dup2socket in the new bsdsocket code.

2004-06-15 22:01  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Fixed a race condition in the new
	  bsdsocket code when asking a socket thread to quit.

2004-06-15 19:04  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Forgot to add src/gui-beos as a configure target.
	  Fixed.

2004-06-15 14:13  evi1rich

	* src/Makefile.am, configure.in, src/od-beos/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-beos/beos.cpp, src/od-beos/gfx.h, src/od-beos/gui.cpp,
	  src/od-beos/sound.cpp, src/od-beos/sound.h,
	  src/gfx-beos/Makefile.am, src/gfx-beos/beos.cpp,
	  src/gfx-beos/gfx.h, src/gui-beos/Makefile.am,
	  src/gui-beos/gui.cpp, src/sd-beos/Makefile.am,
	  src/sd-beos/sound.cpp, src/sd-beos/sound.h: Move graphics, gui
	  and sound drivers for BeOS to separate directories.

2004-06-15 12:48  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/td-beos/Makefile.am,
	  src/td-beos/thread.c, src/td-beos/thread.h: Added native BeOS
	  thread layer based on Axel's BeUAE implementation.

2004-06-14 23:14  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Fixed typos that were stopping the new bsdsocket
	  emulation from being configured.

2004-06-14 22:21  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Forgot to turn off debugging in last GTK+
	  change.

2004-06-14 21:20  evi1rich

	* src/debug.c: Made activate_debugger() obey the target's
	  debuggable() function, so that UAE won't try and start the
	  debugger on systems that don't support it. Also, made
	  activate_debugger() try to switch gfx mode from full-screen to
	  windowed if necessary and possible. This solves the problem where
	  the user could be locked out if the gfx mode is non-cooperative
	  and the debugger is started.

2004-06-14 16:14  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: gtkui.c, led.c: Fixed some bugs in the GTK+ UI.
	  Don't try and redraw the LED widgets if they are not actually
	  drawable - i.e. mapped and visible.

2004-06-14 15:17  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Fixed a bug with the GTK+ floppy dialogs.
	  The main GUI window must be instantiated before trying to display
	  a dialog - so check first.

2004-06-14 15:08  evi1rich

	* src/: inputdevice.c, inputevents.def, gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c,
	  gfx-sdl/sdlkeys.c, gfx-x11/x11keys.c, include/keyboard.h,
	  keymap/hotkeys_common.h: Added support for 3 more hot-key
	  functions to do a warm reset, cold reset and to start the
	  debugger.

2004-06-14 13:30  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: floppyfileentry.c, floppyfileentry.h, gtkui.c:
	  Allowed GTK+ floppy dialog to again be popped up with a hotkey
	  combination.	Martin's patch broke this.

2004-06-14 12:53  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/floppyfileentry.c: GTK+ floppy dialogs now again
	  remember the last directory used. Martin's patch broke this.

2004-06-14 02:40  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Cleaned up AmigaOS gfx driver,
	  re-enabled appwindow support and made the main window's close
	  gadget quit UAE rather than start the debugger (which was
	  completely non-intuitive).

2004-06-14 00:59  evi1rich

	* src/: fsusage.c, include/sleep.h, include/sysdeps.h,
	  jd-amigaos/joystick.c, md-ppc-gcc/support.c, od-amiga/ami-disk.c,
	  gfx-amigaos/ami-appw.c, gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c: Various trivial
	  fixes for building on AmigaOS 4.

2004-06-14 00:52  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-gui.c: Fixed MUIRexx GUI and made it obey the
	  use_gui config option.

2004-06-14 00:50  evi1rich

	* src/sd-amigaos/sound.c: Fixed typo.

2004-06-13 21:42  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-amigaos/: ami-appw.c, ami-win.c: Merged AmigaOS 4 support
	  in AmigaOS gfx driver.

2004-06-13 21:33  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/gfx-amigaos/Makefile.am,
	  src/gfx-amigaos/ami-appw.c, src/gfx-amigaos/ami-win.c,
	  src/gfx-amigaos/gfx.h, src/od-amiga/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-amiga/UAEGUI.rexx, src/od-amiga/UAEWB,
	  src/od-amiga/UAEWB.aux, src/od-amiga/UAEWB.rexx,
	  src/od-amiga/ami-appw.c, src/od-amiga/ami-win.c,
	  src/od-amiga/gfx.h: Moved graphics driver for AmigaOS target to
	  src/gfx-amigaos.

2004-06-13 16:02  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/enforcer.c: Enforcer emulation was horribly
	  broken. Fixed this and enabled support independent of JIT natmem
	  access. Fixed configure support for enforcer emulation.

2004-06-13 02:32  evi1rich

	* src/: disk.c, include/disk.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27

2004-06-13 02:10  evi1rich

	* src/: disk.c, include/disk.h: Fixed remaining compiler warnings
	  in floppy emulation.

2004-06-13 02:07  evi1rich

	* src/: caps/caps.c, include/caps.h: Sync with WinUAE 0.8.27

2004-06-13 02:04  evi1rich

	* src/caps/caps.c: Fixed CAPS support for AmigaOS.

2004-06-12 20:58  evi1rich

	* configure.in: On OS X when linking against libscg also link
	  CoreFoudation framework. Fixes problem with newer versions of
	  libscg.

2004-06-12 16:06  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: Added some optimizations to the SDL gfx
	  driver: 1. The driver now only tries to use a hardware surface if
	  at least    acclerated fills	are supported by the underlying
	  system and then only	  for P96  screens (native screens will
	  always be software screens).	2. When using SDL Fill and Blit
	  routines don't call SDL_UpdateRect to show	the changes on
	  screen. Just flags the modified rows of the display as    dirty
	  and  let them be updated in the normal way. This speeds up slow
	  systems enormously.	3. When using a hardware surface, don't
	  bother marking rows as invalid. It's	  not necessary.

2004-06-11 02:03  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Simplified and optimized the code in the
	  Picasso96 emulation that flushes writes to the P96 framebuffer to
	  the real screen.

2004-06-09 23:30  evi1rich

	* bootstrap.sh: Run aclocal in src/tools directory.

2004-06-09 15:29  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Fixed the delete handler of the main window
	  in the GTK+ GUI to correctly return FALSE so that the window is
	  destroyed in response to a click on the close widget.

2004-06-08 22:31  evi1rich

	* src/blkdev-libscg.c: Fixed ATAPI detection in libscg SCSI driver
	  for platforms where scg_isatapi() is not implemented (e.g. OS X).
	  This makes audio CDs work under OS X. Thanks to Toni Wilen for
	  the atapi detection code.

2004-06-07 22:28  evi1rich

	* src/: gencpu.c, tools/configure.in: Added a bigendian
	  optimization to gencpu which causes the OS X versions of GCC to
	  produce better code from gencpu's output. The odd things is that
	  on all other big-endian systems I've tried it leads to worse
	  code. Thus it is only enabled when targetting OS X (or, rather,
	  powerpc-darwin).

2004-06-06 22:40  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Fixed typo in configuration of dummy joystick
	  driver.

2004-06-06 22:30  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/td-posix/thread.c, src/td-posix/thread.h: Added
	  support for using named semaphores when building against
	  pthreads.  This fixes pthreads support on OS X (and presumably
	  Darwin). Hacked initial configure support for this - must add
	  proper configuration later.

2004-06-06 21:49  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/od-amiga/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-amiga/support.c, src/od-amiga/thread.h,
	  src/td-amigaos/Makefile.am, src/td-amigaos/thread.c,

	  src/td-none/thread.c, src/td-posix/Makefile.am,
	  src/td-posix/thread.c, src/td-sdl/Makefile.am,
	  src/td-sdl/thread.c: Reorganized threading layers in preparation
	  for some upcoming fixes and additions.

2004-06-06 15:58  evi1rich

	* src/jd-amigaos/joystick.c: Fixed compiler warning. Forgot to
	  mention that the AmigaOS joystick driver now builds on AmigaOS 4.

2004-06-06 15:48  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/od-amiga/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-amiga/joystick.c, src/od-beos/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-beos/joystick.cpp, src/od-generic/Makefile.am,

	  src/jd-linuxold/joystick.c, src/jd-none/Makefile.am,
	  src/jd-none/joystick.c, src/od-linux/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-linux/joystick.c: Separatee joystick drivers from os
	  targets. Makes it easier to support multiple APIs on an OS
	  target.

2004-06-06 15:15  evi1rich

	* src/gui-muirexx/ami-gui.c: Added initial support for building on
	  AmigaOS 4 to MUIRexx GUI.

2004-06-06 15:08  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/od-amiga/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-amiga/ami-rexx.c, src/gui-muirexx/Makefile.am,
	  src/gui-muirexx/UAEGUI.rexx, src/gui-muirexx/UAEWB,
	  src/gui-muirexx/UAEWB.aux, src/gui-muirexx/UAEWB.rexx,
	  src/gui-muirexx/ami-gui.c, src/gui-muirexx/ami-rexx.c,
	  src/od-amiga/ami-gui.c: Separeted MUIRexx GUI code from core
	  AmigaOS support and placed in src/gui-muirexx. Added companion
	  Rexx scripts to CVS.

2004-06-06 14:22  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Forget to check in GTK+ GUI changes for
	  disabling audio widgets when sound support is not present or
	  disabled.

2004-06-06 03:58  evi1rich

	* src/od-generic/Makefile.am: Forgot to update od-generic Makefile
	  template when moving dummy audio driver.

2004-06-06 03:54  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/audio.c,
	  src/od-generic/sound.c, src/od-generic/sound.h,
	  src/sd-none/Makefile.am, src/sd-none/sound.c,
	  src/sd-none/sound.h: Moved dummy sound ouput driver to
	  src/sd-none, added configure option --disable-audio to build with
	  dummy audio driver, disabled appropriate audio widgets in the
	  GTK+ UI when sound support is unavailable, and fixed warnings in
	  audio.c when building without sound support.

2004-06-06 00:10  evi1rich

	* src/od-amiga/ami-rexx.c: Tidy up ARexx support in AmigaOS target.
	  Don't build yet on AmigaOS 4.

2004-06-05 23:22  evi1rich

	* src/sd-amigaos/: sound.c, sound.h: Fixed sound support for
	  AmigaOS targets. Both AHI and audio.device sound output now work.

2004-06-05 22:51  evi1rich

	* src/sd-amigaos/: Makefile.am, sound.c, sound.h: Move sound
	  support for AmigaOS targets to directory src/sd-amigaos.

2004-06-05 22:49  evi1rich

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/od-amiga/Makefile.am,
	  src/od-amiga/sound.c, src/od-amiga/sound.h: Move sound support
	  for AmigaOS target to directory src/sd-amigaos and add configure
	  support for building with sound support on AmigaOS.

2004-06-05 20:36  evi1rich

	* src/audio.c: Fixed a couple of compiler warnings in audio.c.

2004-06-05 20:25  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix.c: Fixed compiler warnings when building
	  without bsdsocket emulation enabled.

2004-06-05 20:24  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Fixed typos in bsdsocket section of configure
	  script.

2004-06-05 14:29  evi1rich

	* src/include/sysdeps.h: Don't try and redefine STATIC_INLINE
	  macro.

2004-06-05 14:23  evi1rich

	* src/autoconf.c: Fixed autoconf code so that it will build without
	  stack magic again.

2004-06-04 03:04  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fix for building on GCC 2.95.

2004-06-04 02:20  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Downgrade autoconf requirements to version 2.55 so
	  that'll it'll work on BeOS (autoconf 2.58 doesn't work on BeOS).
	  It'll complain about the AS_HELP_STRING macros, but it'll still
	  work (although the pretty-printing of confingure options won't
	  work). I'll fix this eventually...

2004-06-04 01:24  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix.c: Started trying to tidy up the mess that is
	  the old bsdsocket emulation.

	  Also added an optimization when emulating a blocking socket using
	  select.  When blocking on a recv/recvfrom, we just put the
	  "blocked" socket in the read set for select; likewise, when
	  blocking on a send/sendto, just put the socket in the write set.

2004-06-03 03:55  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Fixed configure support for bsdsocket layer. Don't
	  build new bsdsocket layer unless explicity asked to, and only
	  build it on PPC and i386 archs.

2004-06-03 03:52  evi1rich

	* src/: td-posix/thread.h, td-sdl/thread.h: Add the
	  uae_thread_self() call back to the POSIX and SDL thread layers,
	  since it's currently need by the old bsdsocket implementation.
	  It's actually broken on SDL, but it works well enough for what we
	  want it to do.

2004-06-03 03:50  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix.c: A bunch of fixes for the existing
	  bsdsocket emulation.

	  Aborting of selects in a socket thread now works. The existing
	  implementation, which relied on sending a kill signal to the
	  socket thread, has been replaced (since, depending on the
	  underlying thread layer, we can't always rely on that working).
	  Instead, we create an additional socket for communicating an
	  abort signal on - which the socket thread will monitor (in
	  addition to the network sockets its already monitoring). This
	  idea was shamelessly stolen from Jeff Shepherd's work - although
	  I use a socket here rather than a pipe - because select may not
	  work on pipes on all platforms (BeOS and AmigaOS spring to mind -
	  but the code will still need to be adapted to use local network
	  sockets rather than - as it does just now - unix sockets).

	  Also fixed memory leaks when using pthreads (or pthreads via SDL)
	  caused by threads being created as joinable by default and never
	  being joined with. We now join with a thread when it's given the
	  signal to shut down.

2004-06-02 23:04  evi1rich

	* src/: picasso96.c, md-ppc-gcc/exectasks.h: Fixed PPC inline
	  assembly to work on with the OS X build of GCC.

2004-06-02 10:16  evi1rich

	* src/: bsdsocket-posix-new.c, include/bsdsocket.h: Fixed
	  WaitSelect() in new bsdsocket emulation. AmFTP and other FTP
	  clients now mostly work.

2004-06-01 22:27  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: Don't use host IOCTL request codes for
	  FIOGETOWN and FIOSETOWN in IoctlSocket in new bsdsock emulation.
	  Amiga uses different codes.

2004-06-01 21:39  evi1rich

	* src/native2amiga.c: Add patch from Toni Wilen to protect
	  native2amiga calls with a semaphore.

2004-06-01 21:34  evi1rich

	* src/autoconf.c: Tidy up trap handling. A vain attempt to make
	  this stuff slightly more readable.

2004-06-01 21:29  evi1rich

	* src/: td-sdl/thread.h, td-posix/thread.h: Fix up problems
	  introduced with recent changes to SDL thread layer.

2004-06-01 14:37  evi1rich

	* src/drawing.c: Fixed compiler warning.

2004-06-01 11:45  evi1rich

	* src/sleep.c: Made busy-waiting sleep routine more robust.

2004-06-01 10:56  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Cleaned up P96 emulation.

2004-06-01 09:57  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Added work around for big-endian ARGB32
	  screenmodes in Picasso96 emulation.  There seems to be a bug in
	  P96 which causes colour guns to be swapped in P96's emulated
	  palette in big-endian ARGB32 modes. We work wround this by
	  reporting the mode as BGRA32 instead, and byte-swapping all
	  pixels when they are output to the display.

2004-06-01 09:10  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Added configure support for for new bsdsocket code
	  (with the option --enable-bsdsock-new).

2004-06-01 03:24  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix-new.c: In the new bsdocket emulation layer,
	  we must join with the socket thread to allow it to die and clean
	  up it resources. When the underlying thread layer is pthreads, we
	  cannot always guarantee that threads are created as detached (for
	  example, SDL always creates joinable threads when using
	  pthreads), so if we don't join, the thread won't free it
	  resources, and we get massive memory leaks.

2004-06-01 03:07  evi1rich

	* src/: td-posix/thread.h, td-sdl/thread.h: Implemented
	  uae_wait_thread() for pthread and SDL targets. This waits for a
	  specified thread to die. Waiting for a thread to terminate (or
	  joining with a thread) allows that thread to clean up it
	  resources properly (at least when the underlying thread system is
	  pthreads).

2004-06-01 02:15  evi1rich

	* src/: bsdsocket-posix-new.c, bsdsocket.c, include/bsdsocket.h:
	  Merge Jeff Shepherd's work on the bsdsocket emulation which ports
	  the existing POSIX bsdsocket layer to be a back-end for
	  bsdsocket.c (and thus works like and share more code with the
	  WinUAE version). This still has lots of problems, is less
	  portable than the existing solution, and appears to be slower.
	  Hence, the previous version still remains. The new one is called
	  bsdsocket-posix-new.c, and will be enabled by the config option
	  --enable-bsdsock-new.

2004-05-31 23:30  evi1rich

	* src/: od-amiga/exectasks.h, od-beos/exectasks.h,
	  od-generic/exectasks.h, md-68k/Makefile.am, md-68k/exectasks.h,
	  md-generic/Makefile.am, md-generic/exectasks.h,
	  md-i386-gcc/Makefile.am, md-i386-gcc/exectasks.h,
	  md-i386-watcom/Makefile.am, md-i386-watcom/exectasks.h,
	  md-ppc/Makefile.am, md-ppc/exectasks.h, md-ppc-gcc/Makefile.am,
	  md-ppc-gcc/exectasks.h, od-linux/exectasks.h,
	  od-macos/Makefile.am, od-macos/exectasks.h: Implemented stack
	  magic for PPC hosts. Split up stack magic code and moved into
	  machine-dependent dirs.

2004-05-29 01:41  evi1rich

	* m4/: gtk-2.0.m4, gtk.m4, sdl.m4: Added m4 scripts for gtk, gtk2
	  and sdl to CVS so that autoconf/automake will work on platforms
	  without these.

2004-05-25 14:20  evi1rich

	* src/: blitter.c, custom.c, inputdevice.c, newcpu.c,
	  include/blitter.h, include/custom.h: Lots of clean up in the
	  custom chip emulation, particularly changing key state variables
	  to unsigned type where appropriate.

2004-05-22 15:29  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-x11/xwin.c: Fixed bug in X11 hotkey handling. Key-presses
	  which matched a hotkey sequence were still being passed through
	  to the emulation.

2004-05-22 15:17  evi1rich

	* src/misc.c: Fixed support for P96 refresh rate hack.

2004-05-21 17:24  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-sdl/sdlgfx.c: Don't ask for a hardware surface in the SDL
	  driver. Using a hardware surface simply because one is available
	  is rarely a good idea. We would need to work out when it is
	  actually beneficial to use a hardware surface - for instance, if
	  sufficient hardare acceleration support is available.

2004-05-21 17:18  evi1rich

	* src/md-ppc-gcc/m68k.h: Added a minor CPU Optimization for CPU
	  targets. The flag_struct bit-field was reorganized to allow the
	  generation of slightly better object code.

2004-05-21 15:42  evi1rich

	* amiga/: bsdsocket.library, mousehack, timehack, transdisk,
	  transrom, uae-control, uae-control.info, uae_rcli, uaectrl:
	  Removed Amiga binaries from CVS repository.

2004-05-21 15:27  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: floppyfileentry.c, floppyfileentry.h, gtkui.c:
	  Added support for floppy_path config option back to GTK+ GUI.
	  (Martin's new code did not support this).

2004-05-21 14:47  evi1rich

	* configure.in: Fixed configure.in dependency. Requires
	  autoconf-2.58 or better.

2004-05-21 14:46  evi1rich

	* bootstrap.sh: Fix bootstrap script to run autoconf in tools dir.

2004-05-21 14:45  evi1rich

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure, src/tools/aclocal.m4,
	  src/tools/configure, src/caps/Makefile.in, src/dms/Makefile.in,

	  src/sd-sgi/Makefile.in, src/sd-solaris/Makefile.in,
	  src/sd-uss/Makefile.in: Removed autoconf/automake output from CVS
	  repository.

2004-05-21 13:55  evi1rich

	* m4/uintmax_t.m4: Added missing autoconf macro dependencies.

2004-05-21 04:21  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fixed a bug in BlitPlanar2Direct and did some
	  tidying up. It can't handle source bitmaps deeper than 8
	  bitplanes and it was failing to check for this case, causing the
	  stack to be overwritten and inevitably a crash. This bug showed
	  up, for example, with the v43 Installer.

2004-05-21 03:49  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fix debug logging.

2004-05-21 03:47  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: The previous fix for do_blit() was broken
	  because I neglected to take account of the fact that the source
	  and destination rectangles could overlap. I've now solved the
	  problem in a different and simpler way.  do_blit() now blits from
	  the P96 framebuffer to the screen, but since the blit has already
	  been performed in the framebuffer, the rectangle blitted to the
	  screen must be the updated rectangle - as specified by the
	  destination coordinates.

2004-05-19 17:11  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: floppyfileentry.c, floppyfileentry.h, gtkui.c: Did
	  some spring cleaning on the GTK+ GUI. Tidied up formatting of
	  code, fixed a whack of compiler warnings, and fixed GUI shut-down
	  bug.

2004-05-19 16:10  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Fixed some casting bugs in Martin's patch.

2004-05-19 15:56  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, floppyfileentry.c,
	  floppyfileentry.h, gtkui.c, led.c, led.h: Applied patch from
	  Martion Garton to clean-up and modularize floppy image and LED
	  widgets in GTK+ GUI.

2004-05-19 15:47  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/gtkui.c: Applied patch from Martin Garton to fix
	  64-bit support in the GTK+ GUI.

2004-05-19 15:11  evi1rich

	* src/: filesys.c, fsusage.c, hardfile.c, include/filesys.h: Fixed
	  compiler warnings in hard drive emulation.

2004-05-19 15:05  evi1rich

	* src/native2amiga.c: Removed unnecessary header dependencies from
	  native2amiga.c.

2004-05-19 14:50  evi1rich

	* src/debug.c: Fixed compiler warnings in debugger.

2004-05-19 14:38  evi1rich

	* src/cfgfile.c: Added support for reading and writing
	  <target>.cpu_idle= option from and to config files and fixed some
	  compiler warnings.

2004-05-19 14:32  evi1rich

	* src/gui-gtk/: cpuspeedpanel.c, gtkui.c: Fixed broken method for
	  setting idle-speed in GTK+ gui.

2004-05-19 13:30  evi1rich

	* src/bsdsocket-posix.c: Fixed bug in the tls replacement in the
	  POSIX bsdsocket emulation and cleaned up some compiler warnings.

2004-05-19 13:21  evi1rich

	* src/: inputdevice.c, include/gensound.h: Fix compiler warnings in
	  input device handler.

2004-05-19 11:37  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fixed typo.

2004-05-19 02:21  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fixed a blitting bug in the Picasso96 emulation.
	  When doing a screen-to-screen blit (for example when scrolling)
	  without acceleration by the underlying graphics system, the blit
	  would be first done in then the framebuffer, then on the display
	  buffer. In the case of a scroll operation, this in effect doubled
	  the operation - for example, causing double-line scrolls in the
	  shell console. The solution is, when doing s a screen-to-screen
	  blit, to do the screen buffer blit screen-to-screen - not from
	  the framebuffer.

2004-05-19 01:54  evi1rich

	* src/picasso96.c: Fix compiler warnings in Picasso96 emulation.

2004-05-19 01:43  evi1rich

	  code.

2004-05-19 01:18  evi1rich

	* src/gfx-x11/xwin.c: Fix X11 support for Picasso96 emulation on
	  big-endian displays.

2004-05-19 01:10  evi1rich

	* src/: autoconf.c, compemu_support.c, main.c: Don't include
	  obsolete compiler.h header.

2004-05-19 01:01  evi1rich

	* src/: compiler.c, include/compiler.h, include/events_jit.h,
	  include/events_normal.h: Removed obsolete files.

2004-05-19 00:56  evi1rich

	* src/gencpu.c: Fixed compiler warnings in code generated by
	  gencpu.

2004-05-19 00:38  evi1rich

	* src/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, compiler.c, filesys.c, fpp.c,
	  fsdb.c, gencomp.c, gencpu.c, main.c, newcpu.c,
	  include/compiler.h, include/newcpu.h: Cleaned up and removed
	  obsolete code from the CPU emulation.

2004-05-18 23:44  evi1rich

	* src/events.c: Forgot to add new file events.c

2004-05-18 23:19  evi1rich

	* src/blkdev-libscg.c: Fixed SCSI emulation using libscg on
	  platforms which don't support SCSI bus scanning (e.g. OS X).
	  Still need to add ATAPI-detection code for OS X.

	  Print log message when libscg fails to open the bus.

	  General tidying up.

2004-05-18 22:23  evi1rich

	* configure, configure.in, src/compemu_support.c: Added a
	  compile-time option --enable-noflags which controls whether the
	  JIT no-flags opcode handlers are built, and fixed support for
	  using them.  Previously the noflags handlers were being built,
	  but not used. Now they are not built by default but can be with
	  this option. Enabling the no-flags support does not seem to offer
	  any performance gain, but increases build time.

2004-05-18 22:00  evi1rich

	* aclocal.m4, configure, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/custom.c, src/newcpu.c, src/include/custom.h,
	  src/include/events.h, src/include/events_jit.h,
	  src/include/events_normal.h, src/include/newcpu.h: Tidied up
	  event handling. do_cycles() and friends are no longer inlined -
	  to reduce build time and size of compiled code. They are no in a
	  separate source file. Removed separate event headers for JIT and
	  non-JIT builds, and created a unified events header instead.
