This folder contains a hacked version of the LibSDL's sdl-config configure
script, which is useful for building against the LibSDL framework (rather
than the Fink's version of SDL). It assumes the SDL headers and library are
installed in your home directory.

To use, pass the --sdl-prefix option when configuring. For exmaple:

./configure --with-sdl --with-sdl-prefix=`pwd`/src/od-macosx

This script will not currently work if you are building in directory other
than one root of the source tree (i.e. the directory with the confiure
script in it).
