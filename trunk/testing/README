In this directory you can find some test code sources for E-UAE.

The directories are for:

build_kick - a simple environment to build a Kickstart binary file out of
             (almost) any M68k assembly source file. Please see the README file
             inside the directory for more details.

test_kicks - a few test "Kickstart" sources, that can be loaded into the
             E-UAE emulator instead of the real AmigaOS Kickstart ROM
             binary files.
             These tests are rather simple hardware banging M68k assembly
             programs, they are able to initialize the hardware on a minimal
             level then show some action on the screen.
