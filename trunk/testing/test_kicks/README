Some simple test "Kickstarts" for E-UAE.

You can build the Kickstart file from these test sources by using the tools
in the build_kick directory one step up.

Files in this directory:

iamalive.asm - a very basic test that shows some colors when the machine starts
mandel_hw.asm - a Mandelbrot set calculator for speed testing
