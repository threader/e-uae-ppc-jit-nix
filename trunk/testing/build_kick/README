In this folder you can find a very simple environment to build a Kickstart
binary file on a M68k Amiga system.

To do make use of it you need:

* your M68k assembly source
* PhxAss Macro Assembler (http://aminet.net/package/dev/asm/PhxAss439)
* VBCC package (http://aminet.net/package/dev/c/vbcc_bin_amigaos68k)

After everything is installed and configured on your Amiga system all you 
need to do is execute this command from CLI in this directory:

execute build mysourcecodefile

The environment will look for this assembly file: mysourcecodefile.asm
Compiles it with PhxAss, link it with vlink then finally generates a checksum
number at the end of the file and the final filename will be:
mysourcecodefile.kick

You can use this file instead of a real AmigaOS Kickstart ROM file in E-UAE
Amiga emulator.

The files in this folder:

build - AmigaOS script for building the Kickstart binary
padding.asm - (very-very) simple padding code source
padding.pad - padding object code for reserving some space in the binary
rawlink.ld - link script for vlink to let it create the binary properly
README - this documentation file
romchecksum - M68k executable for calculating and fixing checksum on the binary
romchecksum.c - generic C99 source code for checksum calculator
